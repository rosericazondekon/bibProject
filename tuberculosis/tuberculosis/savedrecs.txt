TI Connectivity of diagnostic technologies: improving surveillance and

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE

ID COUNTRIES; POINT; TB
AB In regard to tuberculosis (TB) and other major global epidemics, the use of new diagnostic tests is increasing dramatically, including in resource-limited countries. Although there has never been as much digital information generated, this data source has not been exploited to its full potential. In this opinion paper, we discuss lessons learned from the global scale-up of these laboratory devices and the pathway to tapping the potential of laboratory-generated information in the field of TB by using connectivity. Responding to the demand for connectivity, innovative third-party players have proposed solutions that have been widely adopted by field users of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The experience associated with the utilisation of these systems, which facilitate the monitoring of wide laboratory networks, stressed the need for a more global and comprehensive approach to diagnostic connectivity. In addition to SUMMARY facilitating the reporting of test results, the mobility of digital information allows the sharing of information generated in programme settings. When they become easily accessible, these data can be used to improve patient care, disease surveillance and drug discovery. They should therefore be considered as a public health good. We list several examples of concrete initiatives that should allow data sources to be combined to improve the understanding of the epidemic, support the operational response and, finally, accelerate TB elimination. With the many opportunities that the pooling of data associated with the TB epidemic can provide, pooling of this information at an international level has become an absolute priority.

AB In 2013, 86% of patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis (TB) successfully completed treatment and were discharged from care. However, long-term studies in industrialised and resource-poor countries all point to a higher risk of death in TB survivors than in the general population. The likely explanation is chronic restrictive and obstructive lung disease consequent to TB. We call for better linkages between TB control programmes and SUMMARY respiratory medicine services, a better understanding of the burden of respiratory disability at the end of anti-tuberculosis treatment, and political, programmatic, clinical and research action to improve the quality of life of affected patients.

AB SETTINGS: Two large tuberculosis (TB) centres under a well-functioning National TB Programme (NTP) in Benin, West Africa.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and results of integrating a programme of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in children aged <5 years exposed to TB as part of the existing routine activities of the NTP.
   METHOD: All children aged <5 years living in the household of a patient with smear-positive pulmonary TB were examined by a doctor and received IPT if no evidence of TB was detected. The children were followed clinically by a nurse for 6 months.
   RESULTS: From January 2013 to June 2014, 496 SUMMARY children were examined and prescribed IPT among 499 notified contacts; 86% adhered to IPT for at least 6 months. There were six deaths and three cases of active TB among the children, all during the first 3 months of follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: In an African country with moderate TB incidence and a well-functioning NTP, the integration of IPT into the NTP for children aged <5 years exposed to TB in the family was feasible based on simple tools associated with the follow-up of index cases. The rate of adherence to IPT was high.

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Tuberculosis; Treatment; Scheduled appointment; Benin; Operational
   research
AB Background: In the "Centre National Hospitalier de Pneumo-Phtisiologie" of Cotonou, Benin, little is known about the characteristics of patients who have not attended their scheduled appointment, the results of tracing and the possible benefits on improving treatment outcomes. This study aimed to determine the contribution of tracing activities for those who missed scheduled appointments towards a successful treatment outcome.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out among all smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients treated between January and September 2013. Data on demographic and diagnostic characteristics and treatment outcomes were accessed from tuberculosis registers and treatment cards. Information on those who missed their scheduled appointments was collected from the tracing tuberculosis register. A univariate analysis was performed to explore factors associated with missing a scheduled appointment.
   Results: Of 457 patients (410 new smear-positive and 47 retreatment tuberculosis), 37 (8 %) missed one or more of their appointments with a total of 44 episodes of missed appointments. The 3.5th (32 %) and 5th (43 %) month appointments were the ones most likely to be missed. Being male was associated with a higher risk of missing appointments (RR = 4.2; 95 % CI = 1.5-11.8, p = 0.004) while having HIV infection was associated with a lower risk (RR = 0.3, 95 % CI = 0.1-0.9, p = 0.03). Principal reasons for missed appointments were travelling outside Cotonou (34 %) and feeling better (21 %). In 24 (55 %) of these 44 episodes of missed appointments, contact was made with the patient who returned to the programme. These follow-up activities increased the treatment success by 4 %.
   Conclusion: In Cotonou, Benin, less than 10 % of tuberculosis patients miss at least one of their scheduled appointments. Tracing activities increase the treatment success rate by 4 % and current on-going practices in the Programme need to be endorsed and encouraged.

AB Setting: The three Basic Management Units (BMUs) of the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) in Cotonou, Benin.
   Objective: To determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among tuberculosis (TB) patients in Cotonou.
   Design: A cross-sectional study of consecutively registered TB patients treated for a minimum of 2 weeks between June and July 2014 in the three BMUs, with measurement of their fasting blood glucose (FBG). A patient was considered as having DM if venous FBG was. 7 mmol/l or if they reported a known history of DM.
   Result: There were 159 patients assessed: 114 with new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), 5 with new smear-negative PTB, 8 with extra-pulmonary TB, 21 retreatment patients with fully susceptible bacilli and 11 with multidrug-resistant TB. Of these, respectively 31 (19%), 18 (11%) and 10 (6%) were human immunodeficiency virus co-infected, smokers and hypertensive. Eight patients (5%) had impaired fasting glucose and three (1.9%) had DM (FBG >= 7 mmol/l), of whom two were already known to have the disease and one was newly diagnosed.
   Conclusion: DM may not be an important risk factor for TB in Cotonou. A larger study on TB and DM in the whole country is needed.

AB In this study, we retrospectively analysed a total of 605 clinical isolates from six West or Central African countries (Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Guinea-Conakry, Niger and Senegal). Besides spoligotyping to assign isolates to ancient and modern mycobacterial lineages, we conducted phenotypic drug-susceptibility-testing for each isolate for the four first-line drugs. We showed that phylogenetically modern Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains are more likely associated with drug resistance than ancient strains and predict that the currently ongoing replacement of the endemic ancient by a modern mycobacterial population in West/Central Africa might result in increased drug resistance in the sub-region.

TI A Four-Month Gatifloxacin-Containing Regimen for Treating Tuberculosis
SO NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

ID PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; PHASE-II; MOXIFLOXACIN; ETHAMBUTOL; TRIAL
AB BACKGROUND
   Shortening the course of treatment for tuberculosis would be a major improvement for case management and disease control. This phase 3 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of a 4-month gatifloxacin-containing regimen for treating rifampin-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis.
   METHODS
   We conducted a noninferiority, randomized, open-label, controlled trial involving patients 18 to 65 years of age with smear-positive, rifampin-sensitive, newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis in five sub-Saharan African countries. A standard 6-month regimen that included ethambutol during the 2-month intensive phase was compared with a 4-month regimen in which gatifloxacin (400 mg per day) was substituted for ethambutol during the intensive phase and was continued, along with rifampin and isoniazid, during the continuation phase. The primary efficacy end point was an unfavorable outcome (treatment failure, recurrence, or death or study dropout during treatment) measured 24 months after the end of treatment, with a noninferiority margin of 6 percentage points, adjusted for country.
   RESULTS
   A total of 1836 patients were assigned to the 4-month regimen (experimental group) or the standard regimen (control group). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups. At 24 months after the end of treatment, the adjusted difference in the risk of an unfavorable outcome (experimental group [21.0%] minus control group [17.2%]) in the modified intention-to-treat population (1356 patients) was 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -0.7 to 7.7). There was heterogeneity across countries (P = 0.02 for interaction, with differences in the rate of an unfavorable outcome ranging from -5.4 percentage points in Guinea to 12.3 percentage points in Senegal) and in baseline cavitary status (P = 0.04 for interaction) and body-mass index (P = 0.10 for interaction). The standard regimen, as compared with the 4-month regimen, was associated with a higher dropout rate during treatment (5.0% vs. 2.7%) and more treatment failures (2.4% vs. 1.7%) but fewer recurrences (7.1% vs. 14.6%). There was no evidence of increased risks of prolongation of the QT interval or dysglycemia with the 4-month regimen.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Noninferiority of the 4-month regimen to the standard regimen with respect to the primary efficacy end point was not shown. (Funded by the Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00216385.)

AB ObjectivesTo inform policy-making, we measured the risk, causes and consequences of catastrophic expenditures for tuberculosis and investigated potential inequities.
   MethodsBetween August 2008 and February 2009, a cross-sectional study was conducted among all (245) smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients of six health districts from southern Benin. A standardised survey questionnaire covered the period of time elapsing from onset of tuberculosis symptoms to completion of treatment. Total direct cost exceeding the conventional 10% threshold of annual income was defined as catastrophic and used as principal outcome in a multivariable logistic regression. A sensitivity analysis was performed while varying the thresholds.
   ResultsA pure gradient of direct costs of tuberculosis in relation to income was observed. Incidence (78.1%) and intensity (14.8%) of catastrophic expenditure were high; varying thresholds was insensitive to the intensity. Incurring catastrophic expenditure was independently associated with lower- and middle-income quintiles (adjusted odd ratio (aOR)=36.2, 95% CI [12.3-106.3] and aOR=6.4 [2.8-14.6]), adverse pre-diagnosis stage (aOR=5.4 [2.2-13.3]) and less education (aOR=4.1[1.9-8.7]). Households incurred important days lost due to TB, indebtedness (37.1%), dissaving (51.0%) and other coping strategies (52.7%).
   ConclusionsCatastrophic direct costs and substantial indirect and coping costs may persist under the free' tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment strategy, as well as inequities in financial hardship.

TI A Care Pathway Analysis of Tuberculosis Patients in Benin: Highlights on
   Direct Costs and Critical Stages for an Evidence-Based Decision-Making
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DELAYS; DIAGNOSIS; POVERTY
AB Background: Free tuberculosis control fail to protect patients from substantial medical and non-medical expenditure, thus a greater degree of disaggregation of patient cost is needed to fully capture their context and inform policymaking.
   Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on a convenience sample of six health districts of Southern Benin. From August 2008 to February 2009, we recruited all smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients treated under the national strategy in the selected districts. Direct out-of-pocket costs associated with tuberculosis, time delays, and care-seeking pattern were collected from symptom onset to end of treatment.
   Results: Population description and outcome data were reported for 245 patients of whom 153 completed their care pathway. For them, the median overall direct cost was USD 183 per patient. Payments to traditional healers, self-medication drugs, travel, and food expenditures contributed largely to this cost burden. Patient, provider, and treatment delays were also reported. Pre-diagnosis and intensive treatment stages were the most critical stages, with median expenditure of USD 43 per patient and accounting for 38% and 29% of the overall direct cost, respectively. However, financial barriers differed depending on whether the patient lived in urban or rural areas.
   Conclusions: This study delivers new evidence about bottlenecks encountered during the TB care pathway. Financial barriers to accessing the free-of-charge tuberculosis control strategy in Benin remain substantial for low-income households. Irregular time delays and hidden costs, often generated by multiple visits to various care providers, impair appropriate patient pathways. Particular attention should be paid to pre-diagnosis and intensive treatment. Cost assessment and combined targeted interventions embodied by a patient-centered approach on the specific critical stages would likely deliver better program outcomes.

LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; HIV; MTB/RIF; MALAWI
AB Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, there is a dearth of published literature on extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB). Objective: To describe demographic, diagnostic and HIV-status characteristics of patients with EPTB in Benin, their treatment outcomes, and among those who completed their treatment in the Centre National Hospitalier de PneumoPhtisiologie (CNHP-P), the proportion whose bodyweight increased during treatment.
   Material and Findings: This was a retrospective cohort study with comparisons made between EPTB and new smearpositive pulmonary tuberculosis (NPTB) patients diagnosed in the country from January to December 2011. There were 383 EPTB patients (9% of all TB cases) with a mean age of 35 years, male/female ratio of 1.3 and important regional variation. There were significantly more females (p = 0.001), children < 15years (p < 0.001) and HIV-positive patients (p = 0.005) with EPTB compared with NPTB. Pleural effusion, spinal and lymph node tuberculosis accounted for 66% of all EPTB. Children, 15 years represented 16% of cases, with lymph node disease being most common among them (p < 0.001). Of 130 EPTB patients registered in CNHP-P, 7% had a confirmed bacteriological/histological diagnosis. There were 331 (86%) patients who successfully completed treatment. More patients with EPTB were lost-to-follow-up compared with NPTB (p, 0.001) with all these patients from one region. The best treatment completion rates were in children,15 years (OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.014.8) while patients with pleural effusion and ascites had the worst outcomes. Of 72 HIV-coinfected patients, 88% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV-positive status was associated with poor outcomes while those on ART fared better. In the CNHP-P, more than 80% who completed their treatment showed an increase in bodyweight and this was more evident in HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative patients (p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: Patients with EPTB generally do well in Benin, although the TB Programme would benefit through more attention to accurate diagnosis and earlier start of ART in HIV-infected patients.

AB To perform a multicentre study evaluating the performance of the direct nitrate reductase assay (NRA) for the detection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis in sputum samples.
   The study was conducted in six laboratories performing tuberculosis diagnosis that were located in six different countries. The NRA was performed directly on sputum samples in parallel with the reference method used at each site. Detection of resistance was performed for rifampicin, isoniazid, ofloxacin and kanamycin.
   Excellent agreement was obtained for all drugs tested at the majority of sites. The accuracy was 93.7100 for rifampicin, 88.2100 for isoniazid, 94.6100 for ofloxacin and 100 for kanamycin. The majority of NRA results were available at day 21 for sites 1, 2 and 5. Site 3 had a turnaround time of 13.9 days, at site 4 it was 18.4 days and at site 6 it was 16.2 days. The contamination rate ranged between 2.5 and 12.
   Rapid detection of drug resistance by the direct NRA on sputum smear-positive samples was accurate and easy to implement in clinical diagnostic laboratories, making it a good alternative for rapid screening for MDR and XDR tuberculosis.

AB In Benin, patients with smear-negative pulmonary TB (SNPTB) are of low priority in the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) and little is known about their profile or treatment outcomes.
   A retrospective cohort study was carried out to determine characteristics and treatment outcomes in all adults registered with SNPTB in 2009. Findings were compared with patients with new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) diagnosed in the same period.
   Of 3140 patients with PTB, 273 (8.7) had SNPTB, with higher rates in northern and southwestern regions. SNPTB was associated with female gender, older age and HIV-positive status (p0.01). Patients with SNPTB had a higher proportion of unsuccessful treatment outcomes compared with smear-positive PTB owing to death and loss to follow-up (LFU) (p0.01). The region with the capital city had the highest rate of LFU. Differences in unsuccessful outcomes between SNPTB and smear-positive PTB were more apparent in persons who were HIV-negative, and among HIV-positives not on antiretroviral treatment.
   In Benin, treatment outcomes of SNPTB patients were inferior to those with smear-positive PTB, with LFU being a major problem. The Benin NTP needs to better address the problem of patients with SNPTB in terms of monitoring and reporting, treatment management including that associated with HIV care, and reducing LFU.

AB Retreatment of tuberculosis is the leading risk factor for drug resistance if the management is not adequate and complete. The objective of this study was to evaluate the management of cases of retreatment in Cotonou. This was a retrospective, descriptive cross type which covered a period of 5 years. Outcomes of retreatment cases were compared against those for new cases that were registered during the same period. We analyzed the cases of 389 retreatment patients and 4542 new cases. The success rates of treatment were generally satisfactory (80% vs. 86%, P = 0.0001). Of adverse outcomes, the rate of loss of sight of was 12% versus 7%, P = 0.26, the rate was 23% for cases of occasions. The failure rate was low and similar in both populations (2%). The retreatment regimen for patients with TB in Cotonou appears to give generally satisfactory results. The high loss to follow-up in case of retreatment means that a personalized therapeutic approach for such patients is needed in general and in particular in the case of defaulters. (C) 2013 SPLF.

AB SETTING: Between 2005 and 2008, the diagnosis and care of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and tuberculosis (TB) services were integrated in Benin.
   RESULTS: The appointment of a TB-HIV Coordinator by the National Tuberculosis Control Programme and quarterly supervisory visits to TB clinics have bolstered the implementation of integrated HIV-TB activities. HIV testing and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy were integrated smoothly into the TB services. The strategy chosen to facilitate access of HIV-positive TB patients to antiretroviral treatment contributed to greater integration over time, but perpetuated, for some, the burden of attending two facilities.
   CONCLUSION: The integration and decentralisation of TB and HIV care services at national level in Benin resulted in a high uptake of HIV services among TB patients.

   and counseling; ART initiation
AB SETTING: Benin, where 20 of 54 tuberculosis (TB) clinics caring for 80% of all TB patients began providing integrated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care in 2005.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and TB treatment outcomes of the first cohorts of TB-HIV patients, and to assess programmatic outcomes.
   METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using data from the TB register and the register of co-infected patients.
   RESULTS: During the study period, 8368 TB patients were registered, 7787 (93%) were tested for HIV and 1255 (16%) were HIV-positive, including 385 (32%) who already knew their positive status. Most patients (88%) were tested within 15 days of TB diagnosis. Female and young patients were overrepresented among the co-infected. Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy was administered to 1152 patients (95%) during anti-tuberculosis treatment, and antiretroviral treatment (ART) to 469 (42%). The likelihood of receiving ART increased as initial CD4 lymphocyte counts decreased. Fifteen per cent of TB-HIV patients died during anti-tuberculosis treatment. Patients already on ART prior to anti-tuberculosis treatment experienced the worst outcomes. Patients who initiated ART early during anti-tuberculosis treatment or in the timeframe recommended by the guidelines fared the best.
   CONCLUSION: HIV care has been successfully and sustainably integrated into TB services in Benin. However, ensuring the access of co-infected patients to more favourable treatment outcomes still represents significant challenges.

AB Mycobacterium africanum is an important cause of tuberculosis (TB) in West Africa. So far, two lineages called M. africanum West African 1 (MAF1) and M. africanum West African 2 (MAF2) have been defined. Although several molecular studies on MAF2 have been conducted to date, little is known about MAF1. As MAF1 is mainly present in countries around the Gulf of Guinea we aimed to estimate its prevalence in Cotonou, the biggest city in Benin. Between 2005-06 we collected strains in Cotonou/Benin and genotyped them using spoligo- and 12-loci-MIRU-VNTR-typing. Analyzing 194 isolates, we found that 31% and 6% were MAF1 and MAF2, respectively. Therefore Benin is one of the countries with the highest prevalence (37%) of M. africanum in general and MAF1 in particular. Moreover, we combined our data from Benin with publicly available genotyping information from Nigeria and Sierra Leone, and determined the phylogeographic population structure and genotypic clustering of MAF1. Within the MAF1 lineage, we identified an unexpected great genetic variability with the presence of at least 10 sub-lineages. Interestingly, 8 out of 10 of the discovered sub-lineages not only clustered genetically but also geographically. Besides showing a remarkable local restriction to certain regions in Benin and Nigeria, the sub-lineages differed dramatically in their capacity to transmit within the human host population. While identifying Benin as one of the countries with the highest overall prevalence of M. africanum, this study also contains the first detailed description of the transmission dynamics and phylogenetic composition of the MAF1 lineage.

AB A 4-month regimen of gatifloxacin with rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide is being evaluated for the treatment of tuberculosis in a phase 3 randomized controlled trial (OFLOTUB). A prior single-dose study found that gatifloxacin exposure increased by 14% in the combination. The aims of the study are to evaluate the initial and steady-state pharmacokinetics of gatifloxacin when daily doses are given to patients with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis as part of a combination regimen and to evaluate the gatifloxacin dose with respect to the probability of attaining a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target. We describe the population pharmacokinetics of gatifloxacin from the first dose to a median of 28 days in 169 adults enrolled in the OFLOTUB trial in Benin, Guinea, Senegal, and South Africa. The probability of achieving a ratio of >= 125 for the area under the concentration time curve to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) for the free fraction of gatifloxacin over the MIC (fAUC/MIC) was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. The median AUC(0-infinity) of 41.2 mu g.h/ml decreased on average by 14.3% (90% confidence interval [CI], -90.5% to +61.5%) following multiple 400-mg daily doses. At steady state, 90% of patients achieved an fAUC/MIC of >= 125 only when the MIC was <0.125 mu g/ml. We conclude that systemic exposure to gatifloxacin declines with repeated daily 400-mg doses when used together with rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide, thus compensating for any initial increase in gatifloxacin levels due to a drug interaction. (The OFLOTUB study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT00216385.)

AB BACKGROUND. The prevention of tuberculosis (TB) transmission in healthcare settings is a major issue, particularly because of the interaction between human immunodeficiency virus and TB and the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB.
   SETTING. Healthcare facilities involved in TB management in 4 African countries (Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, and Togo).
   METHODS. A questionnaire was developed by representatives of the 4 countries to evaluate the organizational measures implemented in facilities involved in TB management. On-site visits were performed between July 2010 and July 2011.
   RESULTS. A total of 115 facilities, including 10 university hospitals and 92 basic management units, were visited. None had a TB infection control plan, and only 5.2% provided education for staff about nosocomial TB. Overall, 48.3% of the facilities performed triage of suspected TB cases on hospital arrival or admission, 89.6% provided education for TB cases on cough etiquette, 20.0% segregated smear-positive TB cases, and 15.7% segregated previously treated cases. A total of 15.5% of the facilities registered TB among staff, for a global prevalence rate of 348 cases per 100,000 staff members.
   CONCLUSION. This survey identified simple and mostly costless administrative measures to be urgently implemented at the local level to prevent nosocomial TB, such as staff education, triage on admission, and segregation of previously treated patients.

AB Objectives. - The authors had for aim to assess the management of tuberculosis and HIV co-infection in Cotonou, Benin.
   Patients and methods. - We made a cross-sectional, retrospective, and descriptive study comparing the clinical presentation and outcome of patients with tuberculosis and HIV co-infection versus patients with tuberculosis alone, all managed at the National Pneumophtisiology Center in Cotonou, Benin, in 2009.
   Results. - The rate of HIV screening in TB patients was 99%. One thousand and eighty-six TB patients were included and 259 were HIV positive. The mean age of co-infected patients was 36 years, versus 34 for TB mono-infected patients. The sex ratio among co-infected was 1.15 versus 2.25 among TB patients. Positive pulmonary sputum was less frequent with co-infection. Two hundred and fifty-seven over 259 patients were treated with cotrimoxazole. One hundred and eighty-five over 234 (79.05%) had CD4 counts < 350. Eighty-five (46%) of the 185 patients with CD4 <350, were given antiretroviral therapy. Treatment success rate was lower for co-infected (75%) than for patients with TB alone (86%), and death rates were higher in co-infected patients (10% vs. 3%).
   Conclusion. - High death rate and high rate of lost to follow-up are arguments for systematic antiretroviral treatment of co-infected patients. Early screening for TB and HIV, and reviewing the current national recommendations, as well as an increased governmental effort to provide medicines to all patients in need of ARV are mandatory.

AB Background: There have been no major advances in tuberculosis (TB) drug development since the first East African/British Medical Research Council short course chemotherapy trial 35 years ago. Since then, the landscape for conducting TB clinical trials has profoundly changed with the emergence of HIV infection, the spread of resistant TB bacilli strains, recent advances in mycobacteriological capacity, and drug discovery. As a consequence questions have arisen on the most appropriate approach to design and conduct current TB trials. To highlight key issues discussed: Is a superiority, equivalence, or non-inferiority design most appropriate? What should be the primary efficacy outcome? How to consider re-infections in the definition of the outcome? What is the optimal length of patient follow-up? Is blinding appropriate when treatment duration in test arm is shorter? What are the appropriate assumptions for sample size calculation?
   Methods: Various drugs are currently in the development pipeline. We are presenting in this paper the design of the most recently completed phase III TB trial, the OFLOTUB project, which is the pivotal trial of a registration portfolio for a gatifloxacin-containing TB regimen. It is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a gatifloxacin-containing 4-month regimen (trial registration: ClinicalTrial.gov database: NCT00216385).
   Results: In the light of the recent scientific and regulatory discussions, we discuss some of the design issues in TB clinical trials and more specifically the reasons that guided our choices, in order to best answer the trial objectives, while at the same time satisfying regulatory authority requirements.
   Conclusion: When shortening TB treatment, we are advocating for a non-inferiority, non-blinded design, with a composite unfavorable endpoint assessed 12 months post treatment completion, and added trial procedures specifically aiming to: (1) minimize endpoint unavailability; and (2) distinguish between relapse and re-infection.

AB The currently recommended doses of rifampin are believed to be at the lower end of the dose-response curve. Rifampin induces its own metabolism, although the effect of dose on the extent of autoinduction is not known. This study aimed to investigate rifampin autoinduction using a semimechanistic pharmacokinetic-enzyme turnover model. Four different structural basic models were explored to assess whether different scaling methods affected the final covariate selection procedure. Covariates were selected by using a linearized approach. The final model included the allometric scaling of oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution. Although HIV infection was associated with a 30% increase in the apparent volume of distribution, simulations demonstrated that the effect of HIV on rifampin exposure was slight. Model-based simulations showed close-to-maximum induction achieved after 450-mg daily dosing, since negligible increases in oral clearance were observed following the 600-mg/day regimen. Thus, dosing above 600 mg/day is unlikely to result in higher magnitudes of autoinduction. In a typical 55-kg male without HIV infection, the oral clearance, which was 7.76 liters.h(-1) at the first dose, increased 1.82- and 1.85-fold at steady state after daily dosing with 450 and 600 mg, respectively. Corresponding reductions of 41 and 42%, respectively, in the area under the concentration-versus-time curve from 0 to 24 h were estimated. The turnover of the inducible process was estimated to have a half-life of approximately 8 days in a typical patient. Assuming 5 half-lives to steady state, this corresponds to a duration of approximately 40 days to reach the induced state for rifampin autoinduction.

AB The present study was conducted in Benin to ascertain the association between exposure to combustion of solid fuel (coal and biomass) and tuberculosis.
   Cases were consecutive, sputum smear-positive tuberculosis patients never previously treated for tuberculosis for as long as 1 month. Two controls were selected from the neighbourhood of each case, matched by age and sex by a predefined procedure.
   A total of 200 new smear-positive cases and 400 neighbourhood controls were enrolled. In univariate analysis, using solid fuel for cooking (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.8), ever smoking (OR 5.5, 95% CI 3.1-9.8), male sex (OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.6-71.1), daily use of alcoholic beverages (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) and having a family member with tuberculosis in the previous 5 yrs (OR 30.5, 95% CI 10.8-85.8) were all significantly associated with tuberculosis cases. When all significant variables were entered into a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the association between using solid fuel for cooking and tuberculosis cases was no longer statistically significant (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.7).
   In conclusion, the association between exposure to combustion of solid fuel and tuberculosis was relatively weak and not statistically significant.
