AB Background Behavioural interventions have been widely integrated in HIV/AIDS social marketing prevention strategies and are considered valuable in settings with high levels of risk behaviours and low levels of HIV/AIDS awareness. Despite their widespread application, there is a lack of economic evaluations comparing different behaviour change communication methods. This paper analyses the costs to increase awareness and the cost-effectiveness to influence behaviour change for five interventions in Benin.
   Methods Cost and cost-effectiveness analyses used economic costs and primary effectiveness data drawn from surveys. Costs were collected for provider inputs required to implement the interventions in 2009 and analysed by 'person reached'. Cost-effectiveness was analysed by 'person reporting systematic condom use'. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all uncertain variables and major assumptions.
   Results Cost-per-person reached varies by method, with public outreach events the least costly (US$2.29) and billboards the most costly (US$25.07). Influence on reported behaviour was limited: only three of the five interventions were found to have a significant statistical correlation with reported condom use (i.e. magazines, radio broadcasts, public outreach events). Cost-effectiveness ratios per person reporting systematic condom use resulted in the following ranking: magazines, radio and public outreach events. Sensitivity analyses indicate rankings are insensitive to variation of key parameters although ratios must be interpreted with caution.
   Conclusion This analysis suggests that while individual interventions are an attractive use of resources to raise awareness, this may not translate into a cost-effective impact on behaviour change. The study found that the extensive reach of public outreach events did not seem to influence behaviour change as cost-effectively when compared with magazines or radio broadcasts. Behavioural interventions are context-specific and their effectiveness influenced by a multitude of factors. Further analyses using a quasi-experimental design would be useful to programme implementers and policy makers as they face decisions regarding which HIV prevention activities to prioritize.

AB Background The objective of this investigation was to study the prevalence of xerosis, eczema, and hair and nail abnormalities in PLWHA in Cotonou. Patients and methods A retrospective study was performed on the records of PLWHA in Cotonou. All PLWHA with xerosis, eczema, or abnormal appendages were included. Results Forty-seven patients had xerosis or eczema. Their mean age was 38 years; the sex ratio 0.51 and the mean CD4 count 89 cells/mm. Twenty-three patients had xerosis, which affected the whole body (n = 20), lower limb (n = 2), limbs and trunk (n = 1), without gender difference. Twenty-four patients had eczema of which eight had both eczema and xerosis. Forty-two patients had abnormalities of the hair or nails. Their sex ratio was 0.80 and the mean CD4 count 110 cells/mm. Nineteen patients had abnormalities of the hair and scalp: straight hair (n = 16), squamous lesions (n = 2), and folliculitis abscess (n = 1) with a male predominance. Twenty-three patients had nail dermatophytosis (n = 15), candidiasis (n = 7), and ingrowing nails (n = 1). These conditions affected more often women (74%) than men (26%). Conclusion The prevalence of eczema and xerosis is low in our patients. Onychomycosis was the most frequent nail abnormality.

AB Objectives. - The authors had for aim to assess the management of tuberculosis and HIV co-infection in Cotonou, Benin.
   Patients and methods. - We made a cross-sectional, retrospective, and descriptive study comparing the clinical presentation and outcome of patients with tuberculosis and HIV co-infection versus patients with tuberculosis alone, all managed at the National Pneumophtisiology Center in Cotonou, Benin, in 2009.
   Results. - The rate of HIV screening in TB patients was 99%. One thousand and eighty-six TB patients were included and 259 were HIV positive. The mean age of co-infected patients was 36 years, versus 34 for TB mono-infected patients. The sex ratio among co-infected was 1.15 versus 2.25 among TB patients. Positive pulmonary sputum was less frequent with co-infection. Two hundred and fifty-seven over 259 patients were treated with cotrimoxazole. One hundred and eighty-five over 234 (79.05%) had CD4 counts < 350. Eighty-five (46%) of the 185 patients with CD4 <350, were given antiretroviral therapy. Treatment success rate was lower for co-infected (75%) than for patients with TB alone (86%), and death rates were higher in co-infected patients (10% vs. 3%).
   Conclusion. - High death rate and high rate of lost to follow-up are arguments for systematic antiretroviral treatment of co-infected patients. Early screening for TB and HIV, and reviewing the current national recommendations, as well as an increased governmental effort to provide medicines to all patients in need of ARV are mandatory.

AB Background: Cancer is a growing co-morbidity among HIV-infected patients worldwide. With the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in developing countries, cancer will contribute more and more to the HIV/AIDS disease burden. Our objective was to estimate the association between HIV infection and selected types of cancers among patients hospitalized for diagnosis or treatment of cancer in West Africa.
   Methods: A case-referent study was conducted in referral hospitals in Cote d'Ivoire and Benin. Each participating clinical ward enrolled all adult patients seeking care for a confirmed diagnosis of cancer and clinicians systematically proposed an HIV test. HIV prevalence was compared between AIDS-defining cancers and a subset of selected non-AIDS defining cancers to a referent group of non-AIDS defining cancers not reported in the literature to be positively or inversely associated with HIV. An unconditional logistic model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the risk of being HIV-infected for selected cancers sites compared to a referent group of other cancers.
   Results: The HIV overall prevalence was 12.3% (CI 10.3-14.4) among the 1,017 cancer cases included. A total of 442 patients constituted the referent group with an HIV prevalence of 4.7% (CI 2.8-6.7). In multivariate analysis, Kaposi sarcoma (OR 62.2 [CI 22.1-175.5]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4.0 [CI 2.0-8.0]), cervical cancer (OR 7.9 [CI 3.8-16.7]), anogenital cancer (OR 11.6 [CI 2.9-46.3]) and liver cancer (OR 2.7 [CI 1.1-7.7]) were all associated with HIV infection.
   Conclusions: In a time of expanding access to ART, AIDS-defining cancers remain highly associated with HIV infection. This is to our knowledge, the first study reporting a significant association between HIV infection and liver cancer in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Objective: To investigate the tolerability of mefloquine intermittent preventive treatment (MQ IPTp) for malaria in HIV-infected pregnant women compared with HIV-negative women.
   Design: Prospective cohort study comparing samples of HIV-negative and HIV- infected pregnant women from 2 clinical trials conducted in Benin.
   Methods: One hundred and three HIV-infected women from the ongoing PACOME trial were compared with 421 HIV-negative women from a former trial, both trials aiming to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MQ IPTp, administered at the dose of 15 mg/kg. Descriptive analysis compared the proportion of women reporting at least 1 adverse reaction, according to HIV status. Multilevel logistic regression identified factors associated with the probability of reporting an adverse reaction for each MQ intake.
   Results: Dizziness and vomiting were the most frequent adverse reactions. Adverse reactions were less frequent in HIV-infected women (65% versus 78%, P = 0.009). In multilevel analysis, HIV infection [odds ratio (OR) = 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08 to 0.61] decreased the risk for adverse reactions, whereas detectable viral load (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.07 to 5.66), first intake (versus further intakes, OR = 5.26, 95% CI = 3.70 to 7.14), older age (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.32), and higher education level (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.61) increased the risk. Moderate and severe adverse reactions were more frequent when antiretrovirals were started concomitantly with a MQ intake.
   Conclusions: This study provides reassuring data on the use of MQ IPTp in HIV-infected pregnant women. However frequent, adverse reactions remained moderate and did not impair adherence to MQ IPTp. In this high-risk group, MQ might be an acceptable alternative in case sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine loses its efficacy for intermittent preventive treatment.

AB Objective: To assess changes in the prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, as well as in different proximal and distal factors related to HIV infection, in the general population of Cotonou between 1998 and 2008, while an intensive preventive intervention targeting the sex work milieu was ongoing.
   Methods: A two-stage cluster sampling procedure was used to select the participants in each study. Subjects aged 15-49 who agreed to participate were interviewed and tested for HIV, syphilis, HSV-2, gonorrhoea and chlamydia. We used the Roa-Scott Chi-square test (proportions) and the Student's t test (means) for bivariate comparisons, and adjusted logistic regression models taking into account the cluster effect for multivariate analyses.
   Results: HIV prevalence decreased significantly in men (3.4% in 1998 versus 2.0% in 2008, p = 0.048), especially in those aged 15-29 (3.0% to 0.5%, p = 0.002). Among men, the prevalence of gonorrhoea decreased significantly (1.1% to 0.3%, p = 0.046) while HSV-2 prevalence increased from 12.0% to 18.1% (p = 0.0003). The proportion of men who reported condom use at least once (29.3% to 61.0%, p<0.0001) and of those having attained a secondary educational level or more (17.1% to 61.3%, p<0.0001) also increased significantly. There was an overall decrease in the prevalence of syphilis (1.5% to 0.6%, p = 0.0003).
   Conclusion: This is the first population-based study reporting a significant decline in HIV prevalence among young men in an African setting where overall prevalence has never reached 5%. The decline occurred while preventive interventions targeting the sex work milieu were ongoing and the educational level was increasing.

AB Objectives As access to antiretrovirals (ARV) increases in developing countries, the identification of optimal therapeutic regimens and prevention strategies requires the identification of resistance pathways in non-B subtypes as well as the surveillance of drug mutation resistance (SDMR) including the trafficking of viral strains between high-risk groups such as commercial sex workers (CSW) and the general population (GP). In this study, the authors evaluated the rate of primary resistance mutations and the epidemiological link between isolates from GP and CSW from Benin.
   Methods Plasma samples were obtained from 129 HIV1-infected treatment-naive individuals. Drug resistance mutations were identified using SDMR list and compared with other resistance algorithms.
   Results No nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutations were found. Four patients had non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance (K103N, G190A). One patient exhibited protease inhibitors resistance mutation, F53Y. Using the SDMR list, the authors obtained a rate of 3.9% of primary resistance. Nevertheless, the authors observed several mutations not on SDMR list but included in others resistance database, taking those mutations into account, the authors obtained a rate of 15.5%.
   Conclusions Although our results show a low rate of SDMR, this algorithm may underestimate resistance mutations that may impact treatment options in developing countries. Primary resistance rates were similar in CSW and in the GP. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the genetic exchange between groups.

AB Background: Most HIV infections are transmitted across mucosal epithelium. Understanding the role of innate and specific mucosal immunity in susceptibility or protection against HIV infection, as well as the effect of HIV infection on mucosal immunity, are of fundamental importance. HLA-G is a powerful modulator of the immune response. The aim of this study was to investigate whether soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) expression in the female genital tract is associated with HIV-1 infection.
   Methods and Findings: Genital levels of sHLA-G were determined in 52 HIV-1-uninfected and 44 antiretroviral naive HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs), as well as 71 HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW women at low risk of exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. HIV-1-infected CSWs had higher genital levels of sHLA-G compared with those in both the HIV-1-uninfected CSW (P = 0.009) and non-CSW groups (P = 0.0006). The presence of bacterial vaginosis (P = 0.008), and HLA-G*01:01:02 genotype (P = 0.002) were associated with higher genital levels of sHLA-G in the HIV-1-infected CSWs, whereas the HLA-G*01: 04: 04 genotype was also associated with higher genital level of sHLA-G in the overall population (P = 0.038). When adjustment was made for all significant variables, the increased expression of sHLA-G in the genital mucosa remained significantly associated with both HIV-1 infection (P = 0.02) and bacterial vaginosis (P = 0.03).
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that high level of sHLA-G in the genital mucosa is independently associated with both HIV-1 infection and bacterial vaginosis.

AB Background: The IeDEA West Africa Pediatric Working Group (pWADA) was established in January 2007 to study the care and treatment of HIV-infected children in this region. We describe here the characteristics at antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation and study the 12-month mortality and loss-to-program of HIV-infected children followed in ART programs in West Africa.
   Methods: Standardized data from HIV-infected children followed-up in ART programs were included. Nine clinical centers from six countries contributed to the dataset (Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Mali and Senegal). Inclusion criteria were the followings: age 0-15 years and initiated triple antiretroviral drug regimens. Baseline time was the date of ART initiation. WHO criteria was used to define severe immunosuppression based on CD4 count by age or CD4 percent < 15%. We estimated the 12-month Kaplan-Meier probabilities of mortality and loss-to-program (death or loss to follow-up > 6 months) after ART initiation and factors associated with these two outcomes.
   Results: Between June 2000 and December 2007, 2170 children were included. Characteristics at ART initiation were the following: median age of 5 years (Interquartile range (IQR: 2-9) and median CD4 percentage of 13% (IQR: 7-19). The most frequent drug regimen consisted of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (62%). During the first 12 months, 169 (7.8%) children died and 461 (21.2%) were lost-to-program. Overall, in HIV-infected children on ART, the 12-month probability of death was 8.3% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 7.2-9.6%), and of loss-to-program was 23.1% (95% CI: 21.3-25.0%). Both mortality and loss-to program were associated with advanced clinical stage, CD4 percentage < 15% at ART initiation and year (> 2005) of ART initiation.
   Conclusion: Innovative and sustainable approaches are needed to better document causes of death and increase retention in HIV pediatric clinics in West Africa.
