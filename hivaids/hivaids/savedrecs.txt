AB Objective. Determine the prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia and associated factors in HIV-infected patients in Cotonou in order to introduce systematic screening in national guidelines. Patients and methods. This is a cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study conducted from June to September 2015 in four outpatient treatment centers with adult patients infected with HIV, receiving or not antiretroviral treatment with a number of CD4 <= 200 cell/mu L and who have given their informed consent to participate in the study. For each enrolled patient, after signing the informed consent form, it was made a clinical examination and administration of a questionnaire to collect general information, treatment and biological data. Then a blood sample for counting CD4 lymphocytes and the search of cryptococcal antigenemia were done. Results. In total, 355 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 40 10.2 years. The overall prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia is 1.7%. All patient with cryptococcal antigenemia have a CD4 count below 100 cells/mu L with a majority having CD4 count below 50 cells/mu L. Body mass index < 18.5 kg/m(2), an alteration of the general condition with a CD4 lymphocyte counts < 50 cells/mu L are the main factors associated with the occurrence of cryptococcal antigenemia.
   Conclusion. This pilot study showed a low prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia in the study population, but higher in highly immuno-deficient patients with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mu l. Given the results obtained, the introduction of routine screening among patients infected with HIV could be reserved to those with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mu l. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB We have previously shown that excess B lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS)/BAFF in plasma and on surface of blood dendritic cells (DC) of HIV-infected progressors coincides with B-cell dysregulations and increased frequencies of "precursor" innate marginal zone (MZ)-like B-cells. In contrast, both blood BLyS levels and frequencies of this population remained unaltered in HIV elite-controllers. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that control of BLyS and innate B-cell status could be associated with natural immunity against HIV infection. Therefore, we assessed blood BLyS levels and B-cell status in HIV highly-exposed commercial sex workers (CSWs) from Benin. We found blood BLyS levels of HIV-uninfected CSWs were lower than those observed in both HIV-infected CSW and HIV-uninfected non-CSW groups. Furthermore, levels of BLyS expression on blood T-cells and monocytes were lower in HIV-uninfected CSWs when compared to HIV-infected CSWs, but higher than those observed for HIV-uninfected non-CSWs. Concomitantly, HIV-infected CSWs presented a dysregulated blood B-cell compartment, characterized by increased total IgG1, increased frequencies of populations presenting immature and/or innate profiles and a higher ratio of IgG(+)/IgA(+) plasmablasts. In contrast, relatively low levels of BLyS in the blood of HIV-uninfected CSWs coincided with a rather preserved B-cell compartment.

AB Background: High risk oncologic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is one of the leading causes of cervical cancer worldwide. We investigated HPV genotypes among women living or not with Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) in two major hospitals in the south of the republic of BENIN in the city of Cotonou. Our objective is to investigate the association of high risk-HPV to cervical dysplasia among women under stringent anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment and in controls without HIV.
   Methods: The investigation was carried out within 1 year period in two groups of adult women: one group with HIV1 infection and under ARV therapy in the National University Hospital (CNHU-HKM) designated as CH group (n = 86); and one control group without HIV infection and attending the hospital Menontin for routine gynecologic checkup and designated as ME group (n = 86). Cells derived from cervical uterine smears (CUS) were used for this investigation. The samples in ME group were selected to have similar lamin A/C profile with CH group. HPV genotypes were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) while lamin A/C expression profile was assessed by western blotting to corroborate the risk of cervical dysplasia.
   Results: HPV56 is dominant in CH group while HPV66 is dominant in ME group. 31 % of women in CH group are infected with HPV compared to 23 % in ME group. Quadruple and quintuple HPV infections are more observed among CH group but not in ME group making HPV counts of 43 in CH group and 27 in ME group. Cervical dysplasia are present in 5 % (4/86) of women in CH group and in 1 % (1/86) of women in ME group at the time of CUS collection. The adjustment of the risk to develop cervical cancer in the future related to HPV infection and the total loss of lamin A/C is not significantly different in both groups.
   Conclusion: Women living with HIV are more sensitive to multiple HPV infection but not all HPV infections generated cervical dysplasia. The effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in CH group may reduce significantly the frequency of cervical dysplasia.

ID REGION
AB Health research capacities have been improved in Africa but still remain weak as compared to other regions of the World. To strengthen these research capacities, international collaboration and networking for knowledge and capacity transfer are needed. In this commentary, we present the Network for Scientific Support in the field of Sexual and Reproductive Health in West and North Africa, its priority research topics and discuss its implementation process. Established in January 2014, the Network aims at generating human rights and gender-based research fully carried out and driven by South based institutions. It is composed of 12 institutions including the Institute of Tropical Medicine of Antwerp (Belgium) and 11 institutions from eight Francophone West and North African countries. The key areas of interest of this network are health policies analysis and health system research in family planning, HIV prevention among vulnerable groups, quality of care and breast cancers. Since it started, seventeen research proposals based on locally relevant research questions have been developed. Among the seventeen proposals, eleven have been implemented. Several research institutions enhanced linkages with local representations of international partners such as UNFPA. The network is committed to strengthening methodological research capacities and soft skills such as fundraising, advocacy and leadership. Such competencies are strongly needed for developing an effective South-based leadership in Sexual and Reproductive Health research, and for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB The consequences of the HIV epidemic on cancer epidemiology are sparsely documented in Africa. We aimed to estimate the association between HIV infection and selected types of cancers among patients hospitalized for cancer in four West African countries. A case-referent study was conducted in referral hospitals of Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Togo. Each participating clinical ward included all adult patients seeking care with a confirmed diagnosis of cancer. All patients were systematically screened for HIV infection. HIV prevalence of AIDS-defining and some non-AIDS defining cancers (Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, liver, lung, skin, pharynx, larynx, oral cavity and anogenital cancers) were compared to a referent group of cancers reported in the literature as not associated with HIV. Odds ratios adjusted on age, gender and lifetime number of sexual partners (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Among the 1644 cancer patients enrolled, 184 (11.2%) were identified as HIV-infected. The HIV prevalence in the referent group (n = 792) was 4.4% [CI 3.0-5.81. HIV infection was associated with Kaposi sarcoma (aOR 34.6 [CI: 17.3-69.01), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR 3.6 [CI 1.9-6.81), cervical cancer (aOR 4.3 [CI 2.2-8.31), anogenital cancer (aOR 17.7 [CI 6.9-45.21) and squamous cell skin carcinoma (aOR 5.2 [CI 2.0-14.4]). A strong association is now reported between HIV infection and Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers including cervical cancer and anogenital cancer. As these cancers are amenable to prevention strategies, screening of HPV-related cancers among HIV-infected persons is of paramount importance in this African context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Assessment of patient satisfaction is an essential tool for continuing improvement of health services.
   Objective: In order to more clearly define what has been achieved and what remains to be achieved, from the patient's perspective, the level of satisfaction of AIDS patients managed at Dafra district hospital was assessed.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on data from individual interviews conducted with patients on ARV therapy for at least six months on 1st April 2014. Erin's multiattribute model was used to identify the content of the data collection.
   Results: Patients were relatively satisfied with the comfort and the fact that some of their expectations were taken into account, such as nutritional support, free drug prescriptions and measurement of body temperature and blood pressure. However, they expressed complaints concerning the promptness of services, the courtesy of healthcare providers, confidentiality and questioned the skills of healthcare providers.
   Conclusion: The provision of good quality health care for AIDS patients in the Dafra health district requires permanent review of healthcare provider practices. Improvements are needed in terms of promptness of services, courtesy and confidentiality. Health care teams must take the sociocultural background of healthcare providers into account in order to develop, test and evaluate appropriate solutions.

AB We investigated the circulating plasma levels of Th1- (Interleukin-2 [IL-2], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma]) and Th2-type (1L-4, IL-5, IL-10) cytokines in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women living in a malaria-endemic area. We analyzed samples from 200 pregnant women included in the prevention of pregnancy-associated malaria in HIV-infected women: cotrimoxazole prophylaxis versus mefloquine (PACOME) clinical trial who were followed until delivery. Cytokine concentrations were measured by flow cytometry-based multiplex bead array. Significantly elevated levels of IL-10 and lower levels of TNF-alpha were observed at delivery compared with inclusion (P = 0.005). At inclusion, the presence of circulating 1FN-gamma, a higher CD4(+) T cell count and having initiated intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP-IPTp) were all associated with a lower likelihood of Plasmodium falciparum infection. At delivery, the inverse relationship between the presence of infection and circulating IFN-gamma persisted, although there was a positive association between the likelihood of infection and the presence of circulating TNF-alpha. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy was associated with elevated IL-5 production. Consistent with our own and others' observations in HIV seronegative subjects, this study shows circulating IL-10 to be a marker of infection with P. falciparum during pregnancy even in HIV-infected women, although plasma IFN-gamma may be a marker of anti-malarial protection in such women.

AB Background: We described reasons for switching to second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) and time to switch in HIV-infected children failing first-line ART in West Africa.
   Methods: We included all children aged 15 years or less, starting ART (at least three drugs) in the paediatric IeDEA clinical centres in five West-African countries. We estimated the incidence of switch (at least one a drug class change) within 24 months of ART and associated factors were identified in a multinomial logistic regression. Among children with clinical-immunological failure, we estimated the 24-month probability of switching to a second-line and associated factors, using competing risks. Children who switched to second-line ART following the withdrawal of nelfinavir in 2007 were excluded.
   Results: Overall, 2820 children initiated ART at a median age of 5 years; 144 (5%) were on nelfinavir. At 24-month post-ART initiation, 188 (7%) had switched to second-line. The most frequent reasons were drug stock outs (20%), toxicity (18%), treatment failure (16%) and poor adherence (8%). Over the 24-month follow-up period, 322 (12%) children failed first-line ART after a median time of 7 months. Of these children, 21 (7%) switched to second-line after a median time of 21 weeks in failure. This was associated with older age [subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.10-1.33] and longer time on ART (sHR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.25).
   Conclusion: Switches for clinical failure were rare and switches after an immunological failure were insufficient. These gaps reveal that it is crucial to advocate for both sustainable access to first-line and alternative regimens to provide adequate roll-out of paediatric ART programmes.

AB Background: We described malnutrition and the effect of age at antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on catch-up growth over 24 months among HIV-infected children enrolled in the International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate Aids West African paediatric cohort.
   Methods: Malnutrition was defined at ART initiation (baseline) by a Z score <-2 standard deviations, according to 3 anthropometric indicators: weight-for-age (WAZ) for underweight, height-for-age (HAZ) for stunting and weight-for-height/BMI-for-age (WHZ/BAZ) for wasting. KaplanMeier estimates for catch-up growth (Z score >=-2 standard deviations) on ART, adjusted for gender, immunodeficiency and malnutrition at ART initiation, ART regimen, time period and country, were compared by age at ART initiation. Cox proportional hazards regression models determined predictors of catch-up growth on ART over 24 months.
   Results: Between 2001 and 2012, 2004 HIV-infected children < 10 years of age were included. At ART initiation, 51% were underweight, 48% were stunted and 33% were wasted. The 24-month adjusted estimates for catchup growth were 69% [95% confidence interval (CI): 57-80], 61% (95% CI: 47-70) and 90% (95% CI: 76-95) for WAZ, HAZ and WHZ/BAZ, respectively. Adjusted catch-up growth was more likely for children < 5 years of age at ART initiation compared with children >= 5 years for WAZ, HAZ (P < 0.001) and WHZ/BAZ (P = 0.026).
   Conclusions: Malnutrition among these children is an additional burden that has to be urgently managed. Despite a significant growth improvement after 24 months on ART, especially in children <5 years, a substantial proportion of children still never achieved catch-up growth. Nutritional care should be part of the global healthcare of HIV-infected children in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Background HIV-1 viral load testing is recommended to monitor antiretroviral therapy (ART) but is not universally available. The aim of our study was to assess monitoring of first-line ART and switching to second-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods We did a collaborative analysis of cohort studies from 16 countries in east Africa, southern Africa, and west Africa that participate in the international epidemiological database to evaluate AIDS (IeDEA). We included adults infected with HIV-1 who started combination ART between January, 2004, and January, 2013. We defined switching of ART as a change from a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen to one including a protease inhibitor, with adjustment of one or more nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Virological and immunological failures were defined according to WHO criteria. We calculated cumulative probabilities of switching and hazard ratios with 95% CIs comparing routine viral load monitoring, targeted viral load monitoring, CD4 monitoring, and clinical monitoring, adjusting for programme and individual characteristics.
   Findings Of 297 825 eligible patients, 10 352 (3%) switched to second-line ART during 782 412 person-years of follow-up. Compared with CD4 monitoring, hazard ratios for switching were 3.15 (95% CI 2.92-3.40) for routine viral load monitoring, 1.21 (1.13-1.30) for targeted viral load monitoring, and 0.49 (0.43-0.56) for clinical monitoring. Of 6450 patients with confirmed virological failure, 58.0% (95% CI 56.5-59.6) switched by 2 years, and of 15 892 patients with confirmed immunological failure, 19.3% (18.5-20.0) switched by 2 years. Of 10 352 patients who switched, evidence of treatment failure based on one CD4 count or viral load measurement ranged from 86 (32%) of 268 patients with clinical monitoring to 3754 (84%) of 4452 with targeted viral load monitoring. Median CD4 counts at switching were 215 cells per mu L (IQR 117-335) with routine viral load monitoring, but were lower with other types of monitoring (range 114-133 cells per mu L).
   Interpretation Overall, few patients switched to second-line ART and switching happened late in the absence of routine viral load monitoring. Switching was more common and happened earlier after initiation of ART with targeted or routine viral load testing.

AB Background: The burden of malnutrition among HIV-infected children is not well described in sub-Saharan Africa, even though it is an important problem to take into account to guarantee appropriate healthcare for these children. We assessed the prevalence of malnutrition and its associated factors among HIV-infected children in HIV care programmes in Central and West-Africa.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September to December 2011 among the active files of HIV-infected children aged 2-19 years old, enrolled in HIV-care programmes supported by the Sidaction Growing Up Programme in Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Chad and Togo. Socio-demographics characteristics, anthropometric, clinical data, and nutritional support were collected. Anthropometric indicators, expressed in Z-scores, were used to define malnutrition: Height-for-age (HAZ), Weight-for-Height (WHZ) for children < 5 years and BMI-for-age (BAZ) for children >= 5 years. Three types of malnutrition were defined: acute malnutrition (WHZ/BAZ < -2 SD and HAZ >= -2 SD), chronic malnutrition (HAZ < -2 SD and WHZ/BAZ >= -2 SD) and mixed malnutrition (WHZ/BAZ < -2 SD and HAZ < -2 SD). A multinomial logistic regression model explored associated factors with each type of malnutrition.
   Results: Overall, 1350 HIV-infected children were included; their median age was 10 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 7-13 years), 49 % were girls. 80 % were on antiretroviral treatment (ART), for a median time of 36 months. The prevalence of malnutrition was 42 % (95 % confidence interval [ 95% CI]: 40-44 %) with acute, chronic and mixed malnutrition at 9 % (95% CI: 6-12 %), 26 % (95% CI: 23-28 %), and 7 % (95% CI: 5-10 %), respectively. Among those malnourished, more than half of children didn't receive any nutritional support at the time of the survey. Acute malnutrition was associated with male gender, severe immunodeficiency, and the absence of ART; chronic malnutrition with male gender and age (< 5 years); and mixed malnutrition with male gender, age (< 5 years), severe immunodeficiency and recent ART initiation (< 6 months). Orphanhood and Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis were not associated with any type of malnutrition.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of malnutrition in HIV-infected children even on ART remains high in HIV care programmes. Anthropometric measurements and appropriate nutritional care of malnourished HIV-infected children remain insufficient and a priority to improve health care of HIV-infected children in Africa.

AB Background: The causes of severe morbidity in health facilities implementing Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) programmes are poorly documented in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to describe severe morbidity among HIV-infected patients after ART initiation, based on data from an active surveillance system established within a network of specialized care facilities in West African cities.
   Methods: Within the International epidemiological Database to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) - West Africa collaboration, we conducted a prospective, multicenter data collection that involved two facilities in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire and one in Cotonou, Benin. Among HIV-infected adults receiving ART, events were recorded using a standardized form. A simple case-definition of severe morbidity (death, hospitalization, fever > 38 degrees 5C, Karnofsky index < 70%) was used at any patient contact point. Then a physician confirmed and classified the event as WHO stage 3 or 4 according to the WHO clinical classification or as degree 3 or 4 of the ANRS scale.
   Results: From December 2009 to December 2011, 978 adults (71% women, median age 39 years) presented with 1449 severe events. The main diagnoses were: non-AIDS-defining infections (33%), AIDS-defining illnesses (33%), suspected adverse drug reactions (7%), other illnesses (4%) and syndromic diagnoses (16%). The most common specific diagnoses were: malaria (25%), pneumonia (13%) and tuberculosis (8%). The diagnoses were reported as syndromic in one out of five events recorded during this study.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the ongoing importance of conventional infectious diseases among severe morbid events occurring in patients on ART in ambulatory HIV care facilities in West Africa. Meanwhile, additional studies are needed due to the undiagnosed aspect of severe morbidity in substantial proportion.

AB Background: HIV testing constitutes an entry point for HIV prevention and access to care. Although access to tests has increased in most low-and middle-income countries in recent years, regular HIV testing among high-risk populations remains a challenge. Understanding the determinants of regular HIV testing is the key to improving treatment-as-prevention programs and access to care. This study aimed to identify psychosocial factors associated with the intention to be HIV tested every 3 months among female sex workers (FSWs) in Benin.
   Methods: We developed an interview questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and other theoretical variables. We interviewed 450 FSWs in their work place. Using Amos software, we applied structural equation modeling to identify the determinants of intention.
   Results: Previous testing was reported by 87% of FSWs, 40% of whom reported having been tested in the last 3 months. More than half of the FSWs (69%) showed a strong intention to be HIV tested during the next 3 months. The structural model indicates that 55% of the variance in intention is explained in descending order of importance (standardized coefficient weight, b) by perceived control, descriptive norms, control beliefs, habits, attitude, risk perception, and normative beliefs.
   Conclusions: This is the first theoretically based study identifying determinants of intention to undergo regular HIV testing among FSWs in sub-Saharan Africa. The results can inform development of interventions to maintain and increase regular HIV testing among FSWs, thus reinforcing primary prevention and supporting early access to care.

AB Background: Regular voluntary counseling and testing is a key component of the fight against HIV/AIDS. In Benin, the project SIDA-1/2/3 established to decrease HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STIs) among female sex workers (FSWs), implemented a multifaceted intervention, including outreach activities. The objective of this article was to present potential advantages and limitations of 3 categories of outreach interventions designed to increase the use of testing services among FSWs in Benin.
   Methods: This analysis is based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Benin from June to December 2012.
   Results: Sixty-six FSWs and 24 health care workers were interviewed. Their narratives revealed 3 main factors impeding the development of appropriate HIV testing behavior. These negative elements can be positioned along a continuum of health care behaviors, with each stage of this continuum presenting its own challenges: fear or lack of motivation to use testing services, inaccessibility of care when the decision to go has been made, and a perceived lack of quality in the care offered at the health care center. Many of these needs seem to be addressed in the outreach strategies tested. However, the study also exposed some potential barriers or limitations to the success of these strategies when applied in this specific context, due to social disruption, mobility, access to care, and hard to reach population.
   Conclusions: To increase the use of testing services, an outreach strategy based on community workers or peer educators, along with improved access to testing services, would be well adapted to this context and appreciated by both FSWs and health care workers.

AB Background: Even among HIV-infected patients who fully suppress plasma HIV RNA replication on antiretroviral therapy, genetic (e.g. CCL3L1 copy number), viral (e.g. tropism) and environmental (e.g. chronic exposure to microbial antigens) factors influence CD4 recovery. These factors differ markedly around the world and therefore the expected CD4 recovery during HIV RNA suppression may differ globally.
   Methods: We evaluated HIV-infected adults from North America, West Africa, East Africa, Southern Africa and Asia starting non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens containing efavirenz or nevirapine, who achieved at least one HIV RNA level <500/mu l in the first year of therapy and observed CD4 changes during HIV RNA suppression. We used a piecewise linear regression to estimate the influence of region of residence on CD4 recovery, adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. We observed 28 217 patients from 105 cohorts over 37 825 person-years.
   Results: After adjustment, patients from East Africa showed diminished CD4 recovery as compared with other regions. Three years after antiretroviral therapy initiation, the mean CD4 count for a prototypical patient with a pre-therapy CD4 count of 150 mu l was 529/mu l [95% confidence interval (Cl): 517-541] in North America, 494/mu l (95% Cl: 429-559) in West Africa, 5150 (95% Cl: 508-522) in Southern Africa, 503/mu l (95% Cl: 478-528) in Asia and 437/mu l (95% Cl: 425-449) in East Africa.
   Conclusions: CD4 recovery during HIV RNA suppression is diminished in East Africa as compared with other regions of the world, and observed differences are large enough to potentially influence clinical outcomes. Epidemiological analyses on a global scale can identify macroscopic effects unobservable at the clinical, national or individual regional level.
