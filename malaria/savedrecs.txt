AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of prenatal maternal iron deficiency (ID) on cord blood serum ferritin (CBSF) concentration and infant cognitive and motor development.
   METHODS: Our prospective cohort study included 636 mother-singleton child pairs from 828 eligible pregnant women who were enrolled during their first antenatal care (ANC) visit in Allada, Benin, into a clinical trial comparing the efficacy of mefloquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Venous blood samples of women were assessed for ferritin and hemoglobin concentrations at the first and second ANC visits (occurring at least 1-month apart) and at delivery. Women were prescribed daily iron and folic acid supplements throughout pregnancy. Hematologic examinations were repeated for cord blood at birth. At age 1 year, cognitive and motor functions of children were assessed by using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of prenatal ID at first and second ANC visits, and at delivery was 30.5%, 34.0%, and 28.4%, respectively. CBSF concentrations were similar between ID and non-ID pregnant women. Neither prenatal ID nor CBSF concentration was associated with poor cognitive or gross motor function of children at age 1 year. CBSF concentrations were lower among mothers who had ID anemia (IDA) at delivery compared with non-IDA pregnant women (adjusted mean difference: -0.2 [95% confidence interval: -0.4 to -0.0]).
   CONCLUSIONS: In a malaria-endemic region, ID in pregnancy in the context of iron supplementation is neither associated with CBSF concentration nor with infant cognitive and motor development. Prenatal IDA around the time of delivery is associated with lower CBSF concentrations.

AB If agro-ecological systems are to realize their potential as sustainable alternatives to conventional agricultural systems, innovation diffusion needs to be enhanced. We conducted surveys among 214 small-scale vegetable farmers in Benin, a food-deficit country in West Africa, on how they perceived the different attributes of eco-friendly nets (EFNs). The nets act as physical barriers against insects in vegetable production and so reduce pesticide use. Understanding farmer perceptions about new technologies helps reveal farmers' propensity to adopt them. Intensity of attitude was measured on a Likert scale, and an ordered probit model was used to determine which characteristics of nets were most influential. Eighteen percent of farmers thought that EFNs would benefit them, but almost half preferred not to adopt this technology at all. The main reason for rejecting the nets was the perceived high labor requirement, particularly on larger plots of land. This largely negative perception was strongest among farmers with large areas cultivated with vegetables, farmers who had little or no experience in a trial, and those living far from extension services. We recommend expanded trials that engage a higher proportion of farmers, strengthening of external support for those wanting to use the nets and further technological development to reduce labor costs, improved access to finance and increased education about the negative impacts of insecticides abuse.

AB Background: Plasmodium vivax is considered to be absent from western Africa, where the prevalence of Duffy-negative red blood cell phenotype proves to be high. Several studies have, however, detected P. vivax infection cases in this part of Africa, raising the question of what is the actual prevalence of P. vivax in local populations.
   Methods: The presence of P. vivax was investigated in a large population of healthy blood donors in Benin using microscopy, serology and molecular detection. The seroprevalence was measured with species-specific ELISA using two recombinant P. vivax proteins, namely rPvMSP1 and rPvCSP1. Specific molecular diagnosis of P. vivax infection was carried out using nested-PCR. The performances and cut-off values of both rPvCSP1 and rPvMSP1 ELISA were first assessed using sera from P. vivax-infected patients and from non-exposed subjects.
   Results: Among 1234 Beninese blood donors, no parasites were detected when using microscopy, whereas 28.7% (354/1234) of patients exhibited had antibodies against rPvMSP1, 21.6% (266/1234) against rPvCSP1, and 15.2% (187/1234) against both. Eighty-four samples were selected for nested-PCR analyses, of which 13 were positive for P. vivax nested-PCR and all Duffy negative.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study highlight an unexpectedly high exposure of Beninese subjects to P. vivax, resulting in sub-microscopic infections. This suggests a probably underestimated and insidious parasite presence in western Africa. While the vaccination campaigns and therapeutic efforts are all focused on Plasmodium falciparum, it is also essential to consider the epidemiological impact of P. vivax.

AB Background: Knowing the extent and spread of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is vital to successfully manage insecticide resistance in Africa. This information in the main malaria vector, Anopheles funestus sensu stricto, is completely lacking in the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria. This study reports the insecticide susceptibility status and the molecular basis of resistance of An. funestus as well as its involvement in malaria transmission in Akaka-Remo, a farm settlement village in southwest Nigeria.
   Results: Plasmodium infection analysis using TaqMan protocol coupled with a nested PCR revealed an infection rate of 8% in An. funestus s.s. from Akaka-Remo. WHO susceptibility tests showed this species has developed multiple resistance to insecticides in the study area. Anopheles funestus s.s. population in Akaka-Remo is highly resistant to organochlorines: dieldrin (8%) and DDT (10%). Resistance was also observed against pyrethroids: permethrin (68%) and deltamethrin (87%), and the carbamate bendiocarb (84%). Mortality rate with DDT slightly increased (from 10 to 30%, n = 45) after PBO pre-exposure indicating that cytochrome P450s play little role in DDT resistance while high mortalities were recorded after PBO pre-exposure with permethrin (from 68 to 100%, n = 70) and dieldrin (from 8 to 100%, n = 48) suggesting the implication of P450s in the observed permethrin and dieldrin resistance. High frequencies of resistant allele, 119F in F-0 (77%) and F-1 (80% in resistant and 72% in susceptible) populations with an odd ratio of 1.56 (P = 0.1859) show that L119F-GSTe2 mutation is almost fixed in the population. Genotyping of the A296S-RDL mutation in both F-0 and F-1 samples shows an association with dieldrin resistance with an odd ratio of 81 (P < 0.0001) (allelic frequency (R) = 76% for F-0; for F-1, 90 and 10% were observed in resistant and susceptible populations, respectively) as this mutation is not yet fixed in the population.
   Conclusion: The study reports multiple insecticide resistance in An. funestus from Akaka Remo. It is, therefore, necessary to pay more attention to this major malaria vector for effective malaria control in Nigeria.

AB Background
   Malaria control through use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LN) is threatened by the selection of anopheline mosquitoes strongly resistant to pyrethroid insecticides. To sustain future effectiveness it is essential to identify and evaluate novel insecticides suitable for nets. Mixtures of two insecticides with contrasting mode of action have the potential to kill resistant vectors and restore transmission control provided the formulation can withstand regular washing over the net's life span.
   Method
   The efficacy of a novel mixture LN, Interceptor (R) G2, that combines the pyrrole chlorfenapyr and pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin was evaluated under controlled household conditions (experimental hut trial) and by laboratory bioassay against pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae in Benin before and after standardized washing. Comparison arms included standard alphacypermethrin LN, nets hand-treated with chlorfenapyr-only and untreated nets.
   Results
   The chlorfenapyr-alphacypermethrin LN demonstrated improved efficacy and wash resistance compared to a standard alpha-cypermethrin LN against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes (resistance ratio 207). In experimental hut trial alpha-cypermethrin LN killed only 20% (95% CI 15-26%) of host-seeking An. gambiae whilst mixture LN killed 71% (95% CI 65-77%). Mixture LN washed 20 times killed 65% (95% CI 58-71%), and thus intensive washing reduced efficacy by only 6% (95% CI 1.3-11%). The chlorfenapyr net killed 76% (95% CI 70-81%). Personal protection and blood feeding inhibition did not differ between mixture and pyrethroid LN; however, the mixture LN was 2.5 (95% CI: 2.1-3.1) times more protective than untreated nets. Standard WHO cone bioassays conducted during day time hours failed to anticipate field efficacy but overnight tunnel tests successfully predicted mixture LN and chlorfenapyr net efficacy in field trials.
   Conclusion
   Interceptor (R) G2 LN demonstrates the potential to control transmission and provide community protection over the normal lifespan of long lasting nets where standard pyrethroid LN show signs of failing due to resistance.

AB Given the increasing use of the eddy covariance technique to estimate CO2 fluxes, more attention needs to be paid to the measurement method used. Among other procedures, the way high frequency loss corrections are established and, more particularly, the choice of the cospectrum shape that is used to implement the correction appears particularly important in this regard. In this study, we compared three approaches to high frequency loss correction for CO2 fluxes measured by a closed path eddy covariance system and evaluated their impact on the carbon balance at the Dorinne Terrestrial Observatory (DTO), an intensively grazed grassland site in Belgium. In the first approach, the computation of correction factors was based on the local cospectra, whereas the other two were based on Kansas cospectra models. The correction approaches were validated by comparing the nighttime eddy covariance CO2 fluxes corrected with each approach and chamber-based total ecosystem respiration estimates. We found that the local cospectra differed from the Kansas cospectra shape, although the site could not be considered as difficult (i.e., fairly flat, homogeneous, low vegetation, sufficient measurement height). The Kansas cospectra have more spectral power at high frequencies than the local cospectra under (un) stable conditions. This difference greatly affected the correction factor, especially for night fluxes. Night fluxes measured by eddy covariance were found to be in good accord with total chamber based ecosystem respiration estimates when corrected with local cospectra and to be overestimated when corrected with Kansas cospectra, As the difference between correction factors was larger in stable than unstable conditions, it acts as a selective systematic error and has an important impact on annual carbon fluxes. On the basis of a 4-year average, at DTO the errors reach 71-150 g Cm-2 y(-1) for net ecosystem exchange (NEE), 280-562 g Cm-2 y(-1) for total ecosystem respiration (TER) and 209-412 g Cm-2 y(-1) for gross primary productivity (GPP), depending on the approach. used. We finally encourage site PIs to check the cospectrum shape at their sites and, if necessary, compute frequency correction factors on the basis of local cospectra rather than on Kansas cospectra.

AB Grasslands are an important component of the global carbon balance, but their carbon storage potential is still highly uncertain. In particular, the impact of weather variability and management practices on grassland carbon budgets need to be assessed. This study investigated the carbon balance of an intensively managed permanent grassland and its uncertainties by drawing together 5 years of eddy covariance measurements and other organic carbon exchanges estimates. The results showed that, despite the high stocking rate and the old age of the pasture, the site acted as a relatively stable carbon sink from year to year, with a 5-year average net biome productivity of -161 [-134 - 180] g Cm-2 yr(-1). Lateral organic carbon fluxes were found to increase the carbon sink because of high carbon imports (organic fertilization, feed complements) and low carbon exports in form of meat compared to dairy-pastures. The cattle stocking density was adapted to grass production, which itself depends on weather conditions and photosynthesizing area, in order to maintain a steady meat production. This resulted in a coupling between grazing management and weather conditions. As a consequence, both weather and grazing impacts on net ecosystem exchange were difficult to distinguish. Indeed, no correlation was found between weather variables anomalies and net ecosystem exchange anomalies. This coupling could also partly explain the low C budget inter-annual variability. The findings in this study are in agreement with those reported by other studies that have shown that well-managed grasslands could act as carbon sinks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense can be diagnosed in the early hemolymphatic stage (stage 1 [S1]) or meningoencephalitic stage (stage 2 [S2]). Importantly, individuals harbouring high and specific antibody responses to Tbg antigens but negative parasitology are also diagnosed in the field (seropositive [SERO]). Whereas some develop the disease in the months following their initial diagnosis (SERO/HAT), others remain parasitologically negative for long periods (SERO) and are apparently able to control infection. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-G, an immunosuppressive molecule, could play a critical role in this variability of progression between infection and disease.
   Methods. Soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) was measured in plasma for patients in the SERO (n = 65), SERO/HAT (n = 14), or HAT (n = 268) group and in cerebrospinal fluid for patients in S1 (n = 55), early S2 (n = 93), or late S2 (n = 110). Associations between these different statuses and the soluble level or genetic polymorphisms of HLA-G were explored.
   Results. Plasma sHLA-G levels were significantly higher in HAT (P = 6 x 10(-7)) and SERO/HAT (P = .007) than SERO patients. No difference was observed between the SERO/HAT and HAT groups. Within the HAT group, specific haplotypes (HG010102 and HG0103) displayed increased frequencies in S1 (P = .013) and late S2 (P = .036), respectively.
   Conclusions. These results strongly suggest the involvement of HLA-G in HAT disease progression. Importantly, high plasma sHLA-G levels in SERO patients could be predictive of subsequent disease development and could represent a serological marker to help guide therapeutic decision making. Further studies are necessary to assess the predictive nature of HLA-G and to estimate both sensitivity and specificity.

AB Agricultural management practices are frequently non conservative and can lead to substantial loss of soil organic carbon and soil fertility, but for many regions in Africa the knowledge is very limited. To study the effect of local agricultural practices on soil organic carbon content and to explore effective ways to increase soil carbon storage, field experiments were conducted on an upland rice soil (Lixisol) in northern Benin in West Africa. The treatments comprised two tillage systems (no-tillage, and manual tillage), two rice straw managements (no rice straw, and rice straw mulch at 3 Mg ha(-1)) and three nitrogen fertilizer levels (no nitrogen, 60 kg ha(-1), 120 kg ha(-1)). Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied to be non-limiting at 40 kg P2O5 ha(-1) and 40 kg K2O ha(-1) per cropping season. Heterotrophic respiration was higher in manual tillage than no-tillage, and higher in mulched than in non-mulched treatments. Under the current management practices (manual tillage, with no residue and no nitrogen fertilization) in upland rice fields in northern Benin, the carbon added as aboveground biomass and root biomass was not enough to compensate for the loss of carbon from organic matter decomposition, rendering the upland rice fields as net sources of atmospheric CO2. With no-tillage, 3 Mg ha(-1) of rice straw mulch and 60 kg N ha(-1), the soil carbon balance was approximately zero. With no other changes in management practices, an increase in nitrogen level from 60 kg N ha(-1) to 120 kg N ha(-1) resulted in a positive soil carbon balance. Considering the high cost of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer and the potential risk of soil and air pollution often associated with intensive fertilizer use, implementation of no-tillage combined with application of 3 Mg ha(-1) of rice straw mulch and 60 kg N ha(-1) could be recommended to the smallholder farmers to compensate for the loss of carbon from organic matter decomposition in upland rice fields in northern Benin.

AB This work analytically investigates the problem of steady film condensation along a vertical surface embedded in an anisotropic porous medium filled with a dry saturated vapor. The porous medium is anisotropic in permeability whose principal axes are oriented in a direction which is oblique to the gravity vector. On the basis of the generalized Darcy's law and within the boundary layer approximations, similar solutions have been obtained for the temperature and flow patterns in the condensate. Moreover, closed form solutions for the boundary layer thickness and heat transfer rate have been obtained in terms of the governing parameters of the problem.
