AB Background: The capacity of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to bind uninfected erythrocytes (rosetting) is associated with severe malaria in African children. Rosetting is mediated by a subset of the variant surface antigens PfEMP1 targeted by protective antibody responses. Analysis of the response to rosette-forming parasites and their PfEMP1 adhesive domains is essential for understanding the acquisition of protection against severe malaria. To this end, the antibody response to a rosetting variant was analysed in children recruited with severe or uncomplicated malaria or asymptomatic P. falciparum infection.
   Methods: Serum was collected from Beninese children with severe malaria, uncomplicated malaria or P. falciparum asymptomatic infection (N = 65, 37 and 52, respectively) and from immune adults (N = 30) living in the area. Infected erythrocyte surface-reactive IgG, rosette disrupting antibodies and IgG to the parasite crude extract were analysed using the single variant Palo Alto VarO-infected line. IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 to PfEMP1-varO-derived NTS-DBL1 alpha(1), CIDR gamma and DBL2 beta C2 recombinant domains were analysed by ELISA. Antibody responses were compared in the clinical groups. Stability of the response was studied using a blood sampling collected 14 months later from asymptomatic children.
   Results: Seroprevalence of erythrocyte surface-reactive IgG was high in adults (100%) and asymptomatic children (92.3%) but low in children with severe or uncomplicated malaria (26.1% and 37.8%, respectively). The IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 antibody responses to the varO-derived PfEMP1 domains were significantly higher in asymptomatic children than in children with clinical malaria in a multivariate analysis correcting for age and parasite density at enrolment. They were essentially stable, although levels tended to decrease with time. VarO-surface reactivity correlated positively with IgG reactivity to the rosetting domain varO-NTS-DBL1 alpha(1). None of the children sera, including those with surface-reactive antibodies possessed anti-VarO-rosetting activity, and few adults had rosette-disrupting antibodies.
   Conclusions: Children with severe and uncomplicated malaria had similar responses. The higher prevalence and level of VarO-reactive antibodies in asymptomatic children compared to children with malaria is consistent with a protective role for anti-VarO antibodies against clinical falciparum malaria. The mechanism of such protection seems independent of rosette-disruption, suggesting that the cytophilic properties of antibodies come into play.

AB Background. Theoretical and experimental data support the geographic differentiation strategy as a valuable tool for detecting loci under selection. In the context of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, few populations have been studied, with limited genomic coverage.
   Methods. We examined geographic differentiation in P. falciparum populations on the basis of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 genes encoding drug resistance determinants, 5 SNPs in 2 genes encoding antigens, and a set of 17 putatively neutral SNPs dispersed on 13 chromosomes. We sampled 326 parasite isolates representing 7 P. falciparum populations from regions with varied levels of malaria transmission (Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Mayotte, Haiti, and the Philippines).
   Results. Frequencies of drug resistance alleles varied considerably among populations (mean F-ST, 0.52). In contrast, allele frequencies varied significantly less for antigenic and neutral SNPs (mean F-ST, 0.16 and 0.24, respectively). This contrasting pattern was more pronounced when only the African populations were considered. Signature of selection was detected for most of the resistant SNPs but not for the antigenic SNPs.
   Conclusion. These data further validate the utility of geographic differentiation for identifying loci under strong positive selection, such as drug resistance loci. This study also provides frequencies of molecular makers of resistance in some overlooked populations.

AB Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) arises from sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes (PE) in the placenta, leading to chronic symptoms in the expectant mother and serious consequences for fetal development. Placental sequestration has been linked to binding of chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) by the var2CSA variant of PfEMP1 expressed on the PE surface, and a substantial body of evidence shows that the immune response to var2CSA gives an effective protection against PAM. We have expressed the var2CSA-DBL5 epsilon domain, derived from a placental isolate from Senegal, as soluble product in Escherichia coli and have shown using different criteria that the recombinant protein is obtained with the native conformation. Using surface plasmon resonance techniques, we have examined binding of DBL5 epsilon to placental chondroitin sulphate proteoglyan and CSA; however, the recombinant protein also binds to other sulphated oligosaccharides, with higher affinity in some cases, indicating that the single domain lacks the specificity for CSA shown by the complete extra-cellular region of var2CSA and placental parasites. Recombinant DBL5 epsilon was specifically recognized by sera from malaria-exposed Senegalese women in a parity-dependent manner but by sera not from children or males from the same endemic region. Conversely, DBL5 epsilon induced antibodies in mice that recognized placental isolates from Benin but not isolates from children. The presence of universal epitopes thus supports DBL5 epsilon as an interesting component of var2CSA to be considered for vaccine development. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Protection against pregnancy associated malaria (PAM) is associated with high levels of anti-VAR2CSA antibodies. This protection is obtained by the parity dependent acquisition of anti-VAR2CSA antibodies. Distinct parity-associated molecular signatures have been identified in VAR2CSA domains. These two observations combined point to the importance of identifying VAR2CSA sequence variation, which facilitate parasitic evasion or subversion of host immune response. Highly conserved domains of VAR2CSA such as DBL5e are likely to contain conserved epitopes, and therefore do constitute attractive targets for vaccine development.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: VAR2CSA DBL5e-domain sequences obtained from cDNA of 40 placental isolates were analysed by a combination of experimental and in silico methods. Competition ELISA assays on two DBL5e variants, using plasma samples from women from two different areas and specific mice hyperimmune plasma, indicated that DBL5e possess conserved and cross-reactive B cell epitopes. Peptide ELISA identified conserved areas that are recognised by naturally acquired antibodies. Specific antibodies against these peptides labelled the native proteins on the surface of placental parasites. Despite high DBL5e sequence homology among parasite isolates, sequence analyses identified motifs in DBL5e that discriminate parasites according to donor's parity. Moreover, recombinant proteins of two VAR2CSA DBL5e variants displayed diverse recognition patterns by plasma from malaria-exposed women, and diverse proteoglycan binding abilities.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study provides insights into conserved and exposed B cell epitopes in DBL5e that might be a focus for cross reactivity. The importance of sequence variation in VAR2CSA as a critical challenge for vaccine development is highlighted. VAR2CSA conformation seems to be essential to its functionality. Therefore, identification of sequence variation sites in distinct locations within VAR2CSA, affecting antigenicity and/or binding properties, is critical to the effort of developing an efficient VAR2CSA-based vaccine. Motifs associated with parasite segregation according to parity constitute one such site.

AB Chlorfenapyr is a pyrrole insecticide with a unique non-neurological mode of action. Laboratory bioassays of chlorfenapyr comparing the mortality of pyrethroid-susceptible and -resistant Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes indicated that operational cross-resistance is unlikely to occur (resistance ratio ranged between 0 and 2.1). Three trials of chlorfenapyr indoor residual spraying were undertaken in experimental huts in an area of rice irrigation in northern Tanzania that supports breeding of A. arabiensis. Daily mosquito collections were undertaken to assess product performance primarily in terms of mortality. In the second trial, 250 mg/m(2) and 500 mg/m(2) chlorfenapyr were tested for residual efficacy over 6 months. Both dosages killed 54% of C. quinquefasciatus, whilst for A. arabiensis 250 mg/m(2) killed 48% compared with 41% for 500 mg/m(2); mortality was as high at the end of the trial as at the beginning. In the third trial, 250 mg/m(2) chlorfenapyr was compared with the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin dosed at 30 mg/m(2). Chlorfenapyr performance was equivalent to the pyrethroid against A. arabiensis, with both insecticides killing 50% of mosquitoes. Chlorfenapyr killed a significantly higher proportion of pyrethroid-resistant C. quinquefasciatus (56%) compared with alpha-cypermethrin (17%). Chlorfenapyr has the potential to be an important addition to the limited arsenal of public health insecticides for indoor residual control of A. arabiensis and pyrethroid-resistant species of mosquito.

AB Background: Mosquito-borne diseases are still a major health risk in many developing countries, and the emergence of multi-insecticide-resistant mosquitoes is threatening the future of vector control. Therefore, new tools that can manage resistant mosquitoes are required. Laboratory studies show that entomopathogenic fungi can kill insecticide-resistant malaria vectors but this needs to be verified in the field.
   Methods: The present study investigated whether these fungi will be effective at infecting, killing and/or modifying the behaviour of wild multi-insecticide-resistant West African mosquitoes. The entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana were separately applied to white polyester window netting and used in combination with either a permethrin-treated or untreated bednet in an experimental hut trial. Untreated nets were used because we wanted to test the effect of fungus alone and in combination with an insecticide to examine any potential additive or synergistic effects.
   Results: In total, 1125 female mosquitoes were collected during the hut trial, mainly Culex quinquefasciatus Say. Unfortunately, not enough wild Anopheles gambiae Giles were collected to allow the effect the fungi may have on this malaria vector to be analysed. None of the treatment combinations caused significantly increased mortality of Cx. quinquefasciatus when compared to the control hut. The only significant behaviour modification found was a reduction in blood feeding by Cx. quinquefasciatus, caused by the permethrin and B. bassiana treatments, although no additive effect was seen in the B. bassiana and permethrin combination treatment. Beauveria bassiana did not repel blood foraging mosquitoes either in the laboratory or field.
   Conclusions: This is the first time that an entomopathogenic fungus has been shown to reduce blood feeding of wild mosquitoes. This behaviour modification indicates that B. bassiana could potentially be a new mosquito control tool effective at reducing disease transmission, although further field work in areas with filariasis transmission should be carried out to verify this. In addition, work targeting malaria vector mosquitoes should be carried out to see if these mosquitoes manifest the same behaviour modification after infection with B. bassiana conidia.

AB Background: To implement an Insecticide Resistance Management (IRM) strategy through a randomized controlled trial (phase III), 28 villages were selected in southern Benin. No recent entomological data being available in these villages, entomological surveys were performed between October 2007 and May 2008, before vector control strategies implementation, to establish baseline data.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were sampled by human landing collection (16 person-nights per village per survey per village) during 5 surveys. Mosquitoes were identified morphologically and by molecular methods. The Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite indexes were measured by ELISA, and the entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) were calculated. Molecular detection of pyrethroid knock down resistance (Kdr) and of insensitive acetylcholinesterase were performed.
   Results: 44,693 mosquitoes belonging to 28 different species were caught from October 2007 to May 2008. Among mosquitoes caught, 318 were An. gambiae s.s., 2 were An. nili, 568 were An. funestus s.s., and one individual was An. leesoni. EIR was 2.05 +/- 1.28 infective bites per human per 100 nights on average, of which 0.67 +/- 0.60 were from An. funestus and 1.38 +/- 0.94 infective bites were from An. gambiae. Important variations were noted between villages considering mosquito density and malaria transmission indicating a spatial heterogeneity in the study area. The kdr allelic frequency was 28.86% in An. gambiae s.s. on average and significantly increases from October 2007 (10.26%) to May 2008 (33.87%) in M molecular form of An. gambiae s.s. Ace 1 mutation was found in S molecular of An. gambiae s.s at a low frequency (< 1%).
   Conclusion: This study updates information on mosquito diversity and malaria risk in rural villages from south Benin. It showed a high spatial heterogeneity in mosquito distribution and malaria transmission and underlines the need of further investigations of biological, ecological, and behavioral traits of malaria vectors species and forms. This study is a necessary prerequisite to cartography malaria risk and to improve vector control operations in southern Benin.

AB Clinical malaria incidence was determined over 18 months in a cohort of 553 children living in a pen-urban area near Cotonou Three cross-sectional surveys were also carried out Malaria incidence showed a marked seasonal distribution with two peaks the first corresponding to the long rainy season, and the second corresponding to the overflowing of Lake Nokoue. The overall Plasmodium falciparum incidence rate was estimated at 84/1,000 pet son-months, and its prevalence was estimated at over 40% in the two first surveys and 68 9% in the third survey. Multivariate analysis showed that girls and people living in closed houses had a lower risk of clinical malaria Bed net use was associated with a lower risk of malaria infection Conversely, children of families owing a pirogue were at higher risk of clinical malaria Considering the high pyrethroids resistance, indoor residual spraying with either a carbamate or an organophospate insecticide may have a major impact on the malaria burden

AB Background: Mixing repellent and organophosphate (OP) insecticides to better control pyrethroid resistant mosquito vectors is a promising strategy developed for bed net impregnation. Here, we investigated the opportunity to adapt this strategy to personal protection in the form of impregnated clothes.
   Methods: We compared standard permethrin impregnated uniforms with uniforms manually impregnated with the repellent KBR3023 alone and in combination with an organophosphate, Pirimiphos-Methyl (PM). Tests were carried out with Aedes aegypti, the dengue fever vector, at dusk in experimental huts.
   Results: Results showed that the personal protection provided by repellent KBR3023-impregnated uniforms is equal to permethrin treated uniforms and that KBR3023/PM- impregnated uniforms are more protective.
   Conclusion: The use of repellents alone or combined with OP on clothes could be promising for personal protection of military troops and travellers if residual activity of the repellents is extended and safety is verified.

AB Background: Increasing incidences of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors are threatening the sustainable use of contemporary chemical vector control measures. Fungal entomopathogens provide a possible additional tool for the control of insecticide-resistant malaria mosquitoes. This study investigated the compatibility of the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin and two mosquito-pathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, against a laboratory colony and field population of West African insecticide-resistant Anopheles gambiae s.s. mosquitoes.
   Methodology/Findings: A range of fungus-insecticide combinations was used to test effects of timing and sequence of exposure. Both the laboratory-reared and field-collected mosquitoes were highly resistant to permethrin but susceptible to B. bassiana and M. anisopliae infection, inducing 100% mortality within nine days. Combinations of insecticide and fungus showed synergistic effects on mosquito survival. Fungal infection increased permethrin-induced mortality rates in wild An. gambiae s.s. mosquitoes and reciprocally, exposure to permethrin increased subsequent fungal-induced mortality rates in both colonies. Simultaneous co-exposure induced the highest mortality; up to 70.3 +/- 2% for a combined Beauveria and permethrin exposure within a time range of one gonotrophic cycle (4 days).
   Conclusions/Significance: Combining fungi and permethrin induced a higher impact on mosquito survival than the use of these control agents alone. The observed synergism in efficacy shows the potential for integrated fungus-insecticide control measures to dramatically reduce malaria transmission and enable control at more moderate levels of coverage even in areas where insecticide resistance has rendered pyrethroids essentially ineffective.

SO MALARIA JOURNAL

DT Article
ID POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; OVERDIAGNOSIS; MICROSCOPY; TANZANIA
AB Background: A recent school-based study in Benin showed that applying a policy of anti-malarial prescriptions restricted to parasitologically-confirmed cases on the management of fever is safe and feasible. Additional PCR data were analysed in order to touch patho-physiological issues, such as the usefulness of PCR in the management of malaria in an endemic area or the triggering of a malaria attack in children with submicroscopic malaria.
   Methods: PCR data were prospectively collected in the setting of an exposed (with fever)/non exposed (without fever) study design. All children had a negative malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) at baseline, were followed up to day 14 and did not receive drugs with anti-malarial activity. The index group was defined by children with fever at baseline and the control group by children without fever at baseline. Children with submicroscopic malaria in these two groups were defined by a positive PCR at baseline.
   Results: PCR was positive in 66 (27%) children of the index group and in 104 (44%) children of the control group respectively. The only significant factor positively related to PCR positivity at baseline was the clinical status (control group). When definition of malaria attacks included PCR results, no difference of malaria incidence was observed between the index and control groups, neither in the whole cohort, nor in children with submicroscopic malaria. The rate of undiagnosed malaria at baseline was estimated to 3.7% at baseline in the index group.
   Conclusions: Treating all children with fever and a positive PCR would have led to a significant increase of antimalarial consumption, with few benefits in terms of clinical events. Non malarial fevers do not or do not frequently trigger malaria attacks in children with submicroscopic malaria.

   AREA; S.S
AB Background: Insecticide treated plastic sheeting (ITPS), sometimes known as durable lining, has potential as a long-lasting insecticidal surface for malaria vector control when used as lining for interior walls and ceilings inside the home. Against a backdrop of increasing long lasting net (LN) coverage, we examined the effect of combining permethrin-treated plastic sheeting (ITPS) with LNs in Burkina Faso.
   Methods: A verandah trap experimental hut trial of ITPS with or without Olyset LN was conducted in the Vallee du Kou near Bobo-Dioulasso, where the two molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s., S (frequency 65%) and M (frequency 35%), occur. The S form is mostly pyrethroid resistant (F(kdr) = 92%) owing to the kdr mechanism, and the M form is mostly kdr susceptible (F(kdr) = 7%). The treatment arms included ITPS, Olyset, ITPS plus Olyset, ITPS plus untreated net (with or without holes), and untreated control.
   Results: ITPS was significantly inferior to Olyset LN in terms of mortality (37% vs 63%), blood feeding inhibition (20% vs 81%) and deterrence (0 vs 42%) effects, and hence altogether inferior as a means of personal protection (16% vs 89%). The addition of ITPS to Olyset did not improve mortality (62%), blood feeding inhibition (75%), deterrence (50%) or personal protection (88%) over that of Olyset used alone. Use of untreated nets - both holed and intact - with ITPS provided greater protection from blood-feeding. The intact net/ITPS combination killed more mosquitoes than ITPS on its own.
   Conclusions: Although ITPS has a potential role for community control of malaria, at low coverage it is unlikely to be as good as Olyset LNs for household protection. The combination of pyrethroid IRS and pyrethroid LN - as practiced in some countries - is unlikely to be additive except, perhaps, at high levels of IRS coverage. A combination of LN and ITPS treated with an alternative insecticide is likely to be more effective, particularly in areas of pyrethroid resistance.

AB The combined efficacy of a long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) and a carbamate-treated plastic sheeting (CTPS) of indoor residual spraying (IRS) for control of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes was evaluated in experimental huts in Burkina Faso Anopheles gambiae from the area is resistant to pyrethroids and to a lesser extent, carbamates. Relatively low mortality rates were observed with the LLIN (44%). IRS (42%). and crps (52%), whereas both combinations killed significantly more mosquitoes (similar to 70% for LLIN + CTPS and LLIN + IRS) Blood feeding by An gambiae was uninhibited by IRS and CTPS compared with LLIN (43%). LLIN + CTPS (58%), and LLIN + IRS (56%). No evidence for selection of the kdr and ace-1(R) alleles was observed with the combinations, whereas a survival advantage of mosquitoes bearing the ace-1(R) mutation was observed with IRS and CTPS. The results suggest that the combination of the two interventions constitutes a potential tool for vector-resistance management

SO MALARIA JOURNAL

AB Background: Variant surface antigens (VSA) expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells constitute a key for parasite sequestration and immune evasion. In distinct malaria pathologies, such as placental malaria, specific antibody response against VSA provides protection. This study investigated the antibody response specifically directed against VSA expressed by parasites isolated from individuals presenting a given type of clinical presentation.
   Methods: Plasma and isolates were obtained from four groups of Beninese subjects: healthy adults, patients presenting uncomplicated malaria (UM), cerebral malaria (CM), or pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM). The reactivity of plasma samples from each clinical group was measured by flow cytometry against parasites isolated from individuals from each clinical group.
   Results: Antibody responses against VSA(UM) were predominant in CM, UM and HA plasmas. When analysed according to age in all plasma groups, anti-VSA(CM) and -VSA(UM) antibody levels were similar until six years of age. In older groups (6-18 and > 19 years of age), VSA(UM) antibody levels were higher than VSA(CM) antibody levels (P = .01, P = .0008, respectively). Mean MFI values, measured in all plasmas groups except the PAM plasmas, remained low for anti-VSA(PAM) antibodies and did not vary with age. One month after infection the level of anti-VSA antibodies able to recognize heterologous VSA(CM) variants was increased in CM patients. In UM patients, antibody levels directed against heterologous VSA(UM) were similar, both during the infection and one month later.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, this study suggests the existence of serologically distinct VSA(CM) and VSA(UM). CM isolates were shown to share common epitopes. Specific antibody response to VSA(UM) was predominant, suggesting a relative low diversity of VSA(UM) in the study area.

TI Bendiocarb, a potential alternative against pyrethroid resistant

SO MALARIA JOURNAL

ID IMPREGNATED BEDNETS; INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE; CULEX-QUINQUEFASCIATUS;
   COMBINATION; MOSQUITOS; AREA
AB Background: Anopheles gambiae, the main malaria vector in Benin has developed high level of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, which is a serious concern to the future use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). In this context, one of the pathways available for malaria vector control would be to investigate alternative classes of insecticides with different mode of action than that of pyrethroids. The goal of this study was to evaluate under field conditions the efficacy of a carbamate (bendiocarb) and an organophosphate (fenitrothion) against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s.s.
   Methods: Wild populations and females from laboratory colonies of five days old An. gambiae were bio-assayed during this study. Two pyrethroids (deltamethrin and alphacypermethrin), an organophosphate (fenitrothion), a carbamate (bendiocarb) and a mixture of an organophosphate (chlorpyriphos + a pyrethroid deltamethrin) were compared in experimental huts as IRS treatments. Insecticides were applied in the huts using a hand-operated compression sprayer. The deterrency, exophily, blood feeding rate and mortality induced by these insecticides against An. gambiae were compared to the untreated control huts.
   Results: Deltamethrin, alphacypermethrin and bendiocarb treatment significantly reduced mosquito entry into the huts (p < 0.05) compared to untreated huts. Blood feeding rates in huts treated with fenitrothion and the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin were reduced from 10.95% respectively to 3.7% and 4.47% three months after treatment and from 10.20% to 4.4% and 2.04% four months after treatment. Exophily rates in huts with deltamethrin, alphacypermethrin and the mixture chlorpyriphos/ deltamethrin were significantly higher than in the huts with fenitrothion. Deltamethrin and alphacypermethrin had the lowest mortality rate while fenitrothion killed 100% of An. gambiae (in the first month) and 77.8% (in the fourth month). Bendiocarb and the mixture chlorpyriphos/ deltamethrin mortality rates ranged from 97.9 to 100% the first month and 77.7-88% the third month respectively.
   Conclusion: After four months, fenitrothion, bendiocarb and the mixture chlorpyriphos/ deltamethrin performed effectively against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles. These results showed that bendiocarb could be recommended as an effective insecticide for use in IRS operations in Benin, particularly as the mixture chlorpyriphos/ deltamethrin does not have WHOPES authorization and complaints were mentioned by the sleepers about the safety and smell of fenitrothion.

AB For the fight against malaria, the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the need for indicators to evaluate the efficacy of vector-control strategies. This study investigates a potential immunological marker, based on human antibody responses to Anopheles saliva, as a new indicator to evaluate the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Parasitological, entomological, and immunological assessments were carried out in children and adults from a malaria-endemic region of Angola before and after the introduction of ITNs. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels to An. gambiae saliva were positively associated with the intensity of An. gambiae exposure and malaria infection. A significant decrease in the anti-saliva IgG response was observed after the introduction of ITNs, and this was associated with a drop in parasite load. This study represents the first stage in the development of a new indicator to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vector-control strategies, which could apply in other arthropod vector-borne diseases.

AB Background: Placental malaria is a disease linked to the sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells (IRBC) in the placenta, leading to reduced materno-fetal exchanges and to local inflammation. One of the virulence factors of P. falciparum involved in cytoadherence to chondroitin sulfate A, its placental receptor, is the adhesive protein VAR2CSA. Its localisation on the surface of IRBC makes it accessible to the immune system. VAR2CSA contains six DBL domains. The DBL6 epsilon domain is the most variable. High variability constitutes a means for the parasite to evade the host immune response. The DBL6 epsilon domain could constitute a very attractive basis for a vaccine candidate but its reported variability necessitates, for antigenic characterisations, identifying and classifying commonalities across isolates.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Local alignment analysis of the DBL6 epsilon domain had revealed that it is not as variable as previously described. Variability is concentrated in seven regions present on the surface of the DBL6 epsilon domain. The main goal of our work is to classify and group variable sequences that will simplify further research to determine dominant epitopes. Firstly, variable sequences were grouped following their average percent pairwise identity (APPI). Groups comprising many variable sequences sharing low variability were found. Secondly, ELISA experiments following the IgG recognition of a recombinant DBL6 epsilon domain, and of peptides mimicking its seven variable blocks, allowed to determine an APPI cut-off and to isolate groups represented by a single consensus sequence.
   Conclusions/Significance: A new sequence approach is used to compare variable regions in sequences that have extensive segmental gene relationship. Using this approach, the VAR2CSA DBL6 domain is composed of 7 variable blocks with limited polymorphism. Each variable block is composed of a limited number of consensus types. Based on peptide based ELISA, variable blocks with 85% or greater sequence identity are expected to be recognized equally well by antibody and can be considered the same consensus type. Therefore, the analysis of the antibody response against the classified small number of sequences should be helpful to determine epitopes.

AB In this laboratory study, we investigated the attractiveness of gravid Aedes aegypti females for aquatic habitats containing either NPK fertilizer or plant matter or a mixture of both. The development of larvae, adult emergence and weight of emerged adults were measured for each group and physicochemical analysis of water was made for the dosage of minerals and organic compounds. After 23 days experiment, NPK solution remained as attractive as the mixture of NPK + plant matter but did not ensure suitable development of larvae. The plant matter infusion showed less attractiveness for laying eggs than NPK but provided larvae with sufficient organic nutrients for their development. The combination of both NPK + plant matter provided the greatest attractiveness for gravid females and sufficient organic substance allowing mosquito larvae to grow. Physicochemical analyses of water containing NPK showed minerals only (NH(4)(+)+NO(3)(-)+P+K) whereas plant matter showed high content of carbon and nitrogen. The NPK + plant matter mixture contained both organic and minerals elements that favoured the proliferation of bacteria and then the development of mosquito larvae. These findings could lead to the development of new traps that could attract females mosquitoes and killed hatched larvae if mix with appropriate larvicides.

AB Members of the Anopheles gambiae complex are among the best malaria vectors in the world, but their vectorial capacities vary between species and populations A large-scale sampling of An gambiae sensu law was carried out in 2006 and 2007 in various bioclimatic areas of Benin (West Africa) The objective of this study was to collate data on the relative frequencies of species and forms within the An gambiae complex and to produce a map of their spatial distribution Sampling took place at 30 sites and 2122 females were analyzed Two species were identified through molecular methods. The overall collection showed a preponderance of All gambiae s s, but unexpectedly. An arabiensis was reported in the coastal-Guinean bioclimatic area characterized by a mean annual rainfall of >1500 mm where only An gambiae s.s was reported previously. Our study of Benin indicates that An. arabiensis would be adapted not only to the urban areas but also to the rural humid regions Among 1717 An gambiae s s, 26.5% were of the M form and 73.3% were S form. Few hybrid specimens between the M and S forms were observed (0.2%) Only the spatial distribution of the M form appears to be mainly a function of bioclimatic area.
   Factors that influence the distribution of these malaria vectors are discussed. This study underlines the need of further investigations of biological, ecological, and behavioral traits of these species and forms to better appreciate their vectorial capacities Acquisition of entomological field data appears essential to better estimate the stratification of malaria risk and help improve malaria vector control interventions (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB In Europe, virological and epidemiological data collected in wild birds and horses suggest that a recurrent circulation of West Nile virus (WNV) could exist in some areas. Whether this circulation is permanent (due to overwintering mechanisms) or not remains unknown. The current conception of WNV epidemiology suggests that it is not: this conception combines an enzootic WNV circulation in tropical Africa with seasonal introductions of the virus in Europe by migratory birds. The objectives of this work were to (i) model this conception of WNV global circulation; and (ii) evaluate whether the model could reproduce data and patterns observed in Europe and Africa in vectors, horses, and birds. The model was calibrated using published seroprevalence data obtained from African (Senegal) and European (Spain) wild birds, and validated using independent, published data: seroprevalence rates in migratory and resident wild birds, minimal infection rates in vectors, as well as seroprevalence and incidence rates in horses. According to this model, overwintering mechanisms are not needed to reproduce the observed data. However, the existence of such mechanisms cannot be ruled out.

AB Background: Due to the spread of pyrethroid-resistance in malaria vectors in Africa, new strategies and tools are urgently needed to better control malaria transmission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a new mosaic long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN), i.e. PermaNet (R) 3.0, against wild pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae s.l. in West and Central Africa.
   Methods: A multi centre experimental hut trial was conducted in Malanville (Benin), Vallee du Kou (Burkina Faso) and Pitoa (Cameroon) to investigate the exophily, blood feeding inhibition and mortality induced by PermaNet (R) 3.0 (i.e. a mosaic net containing piperonyl butoxide and deltamethrin on the roof) comparatively to the WHO recommended PermaNet (R) 2.0 (unwashed and washed 20-times) and a conventionally deltamethrin-treated net (CTN).
   Results: The personal protection and insecticidal activity of PermaNet 3.0 and PermaNet (R) 2.0 were excellent (>80%) in the "pyrethroid-tolerant" area of Malanville. In the pyrethroid-resistance areas of Pitoa (metabolic resistance) and Vallee du Kou (presence of the L1014F kdr mutation), PermaNet (R) 3.0 showed equal or better performances than PermaNet (R) 2.0. It should be noted however that the deltamethrin content on PermaNet (R) 3.0 was up to twice higher than that of PermaNet (R) 2.0. Significant reduction of efficacy of both LLIN was noted after 20 washes although PermaNet (R) 3.0 still fulfilled the WHO requirement for LLIN.
   Conclusion: The use of combination nets for malaria control offers promising prospects. However, further investigations are needed to demonstrate the benefits of using PermaNet (R) 3.0 for the control of pyrethroid resistant mosquito populations in Africa.

AB Background: Applying the switch from presumptive treatment of malaria to new policies of anti-malarial prescriptions restricted to parasitologically-confirmed cases is a still unsolved challenge. Pragmatic studies can provide data on consequences of such a switch. In order to assess whether restricting anti-malarials to rapid diagnostic test (RDT)confirmed cases in children of between five and 15 years of age is consistent with an adequate management of fevers, a school-based study was performed in Allada, Benin.
   Methods: Children in the index group (with fever and a negative RDT) and the matched control group (without fever and a negative RDT) were not prescribed anti-malarials and actively followed-up during 14 days. Blood smears were collected at each assessment. Self-medication with chloroquine and quinine was assessed with blood spots. Malaria attacks during the follow-up were defined by persistent or recurrent fever concomitant to a positive malaria test.
   Results: 484 children were followed-up (242 in each group). At day 3, fever had disappeared in 94% of children from the index group. The incidence of malaria was similar (five cases in the index group and seven cases in the control group) between groups. Self-medication with chloroquine and quinine in this cohort was uncommon.
   Conclusions: Applying a policy of restricting anti-malarials to RDT-confirmed cases is consistent with an adequate management of fevers in this population. Further studies on the management of fever in younger children are of upmost importance.

ID PYRETHROID RESISTANCE; BURKINA-FASO; TREATED NETS; MALARIA CONTROL;
   WEST-AFRICA; AREA; IDENTIFICATION; MUTATION; NIGERIA; COMPLEX
AB Background: The emergence of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae has become a serious concern to the future success of malaria control. In Benin, the National Malaria Control Programme has recently planned to scaling up long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria prevention. It is, therefore, crucial to monitor the level and type of insecticide resistance in An. gambiae, particularly in southern Benin where reduced efficacy of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and IRS has previously been reported.
   Methods: The protocol was based on mosquito collection during both dry and rainy seasons across forty districts selected in southern Benin. Bioassay were performed on adults collected from the field to assess the susceptibility of malaria vectors to insecticide-impregnated papers (permethrin 0.75%, delthamethrin 0.05%, DDT 4%, and bendiocarb 0.1%) following WHOPES guidelines. The species within An. gambiae complex, molecular form and presence of kdr and ace-1 mutations were determined by PCR.
   Results: Strong resistance to permethrin and DDT was found in An. gambiae populations from southern Benin, except in Aglangandan where mosquitoes were fully susceptible (mortality 100%) to all insecticides tested. PCR showed the presence of two sub-species of An. gambiae, namely An. gambiae s.s, and Anopheles melas, with a predominance for An. gambiae s.s (98%). The molecular M form of An. gambiae was predominant in southern Benin (97%). The kdr mutation was detected in all districts at various frequency (1% to 95%) whereas the Ace-1 mutation was found at a very low frequency (<= 5%).
   Conclusion: This study showed a widespread resistance to permethrin in An. gambiae populations from southern Benin, with a significant increase of kdr frequency compared to what was observed previously in Benin. The low frequency of Ace-1 recorded in all populations is encouraging for the use of bendiocarb as an alternative insecticide to pyrethroids for IRS in Benin.

   AFRICA
AB Background: Scaling up of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with support from the Global Fund and President's Malaria Initiative is providing increased opportunities for malaria control in Africa. The most cost-effective and longest-lasting residual insecticide DDT is also the most environmentally persistent. Alternative residual insecticides exist, but are too short-lived or too expensive to sustain. Dow Agrosciences have developed a microencapsulated formulation (CS) of the organophosphate chlorpyrifos methyl as a cost-effective, long-lasting alternative to DDT.
   Methods: Chlorpyrifos methyl CS was tested as an IRS or ITN treatment in experimental huts in an area of Benin where Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasiactus are resistant to pyrethroids, but susceptible to organophosphates. Efficacy and residual activity was compared to that of DDT and the pyrethroid lambdacyalothrin.
   Results: IRS with chlorpyrifos methyl killed 95% of An. gambiae that entered the hut as compared to 31% with lambdacyhalothrin and 50% with DDT. Control of Cx. quinquefasciatus showed a similar trend; although the level of mortality with chlorpyrifos methyl was lower (66%) it was still much higher than for DDT (14%) or pyrethroid (15%) treatments. Nets impregnated with lambdacyhalothrin were compromized by resistance, killing only 30% of An. gambiae and 8% of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Nets impregnated with chlorpyrifos methyl killed more (45% of An gambiae and 15% of Cx. quinquefasciatus), but its activity on netting was of short duration. Contact bioassays on the sprayed cement-sand walls over the nine months of monitoring showed no loss of activity of chlorpyrifos methyl, whereas lambdacyhalothrin and DDT lost activity within a few months of spraying.
   Conclusion: As an IRS treatment against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes chlorpyrifos methyl CS outperformed DDT and lambdacyhalothrin. In IRS campaigns, chlorpyrifos methyl CS should show higher, more-sustained levels of malaria transmission control than conventional formulations of DDT or pyrethroids. The remarkable residual activity indicates that cost-effective alternatives to DDT are feasible through modern formulation technology.

   POPULATIONS; COMPETITION; DOMINANCE
AB Background: The G119S mutation responsible for insensitive acetylcholinesterase resistance to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides has recently been reported from natural populations of Anopheles gambiae in West Africa. These reports suggest there are costs of resistance associated with this mutation for An. gambiae, especially for homozygous individuals, and these costs could be influential in determining the frequency of carbamate resistance in these populations.
   Methods: Life-history traits of the AcerKis and Kisumu strains of An. gambiae were compared following the manipulation of larval food availability in three separate experiments conducted in an insecticide-free laboratory environment. These two strains share the same genetic background, but differ in being homozygous for the presence or absence of the G119S mutation at the ace-1 locus, respectively.
   Results: Pupae of the resistant strain were significantly more likely to die during pupation than those of the susceptible strain. Ages at pupation were significantly earlier for the resistant strain and their dry starved weights were significantly lighter; this difference in weight remained when the two strains were matched for ages at pupation.
   Conclusions: The main cost of resistance found for An. gambiae mosquitoes homozygous for the G119S mutation was that they were significantly more likely to die during pupation than their susceptible counterparts, and they did so across a range of larval food conditions. Comparing the frequency of G119S in fourth instar larvae and adults emerging from the same populations would provide a way to test whether this cost of resistance is being expressed in natural populations of An. gambiae and influencing the dynamics of this resistance mutation.

AB The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894), is an invasive species that can be found on all continents. The species, originally considered a secondary vector of viruses such as Dengue viruses, has recently been suggested to play a role in the transmission of Chikungunya virus in several countries bordering the Indian Ocean, Central Africa and Europe. Here we review the current geographic range and the relevant biological traits of A. albopictus in order to explain its rapid spread. We examine and discuss recent changes in its role as a vector, particularly in the transmission of arboviruses, and its importance in the current and future emergence of pathogens. Finally, we report conventional and innovative ways to control A. albopictus. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Malaria in pregnancy is associated with immunological abnormalities in the newborns, such as hampered T-helper 1 responses and increased T-regulatory responses, while the effect of maternal Plasmodium falciparum infection on foetal innate immunity is still controversial.
   Materials and methods: The immunophenotype and cytokine release by dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes were evaluated in cord blood from 59 Beninese women with or without malaria infection by using flow cytometry.
   Results: Accumulation of malaria pigment in placenta was associated with a partial maturation of cord blood myeloid and plasmacytoid DC, as reflected by an up-regulated expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, but not CD86 molecules. Cells of newborns of mothers with malaria pigment in their placenta also exhibited significantly increased cytokine responses upon TLR9 stimulation. In addition, maternal age and parity influenced the absolute numbers and activation status of cord blood antigen-presenting cells. Lastly, maternal age, but not parity, influenced TLR3, 4 and 9 responses in cord blood cells.
   Discussion: Our findings support the view that placental parasitization, as indicated by the presence of malaria pigment in placental leukocytes, is significantly associated with partial maturation of different DC subsets and also to slightly increased responses to TLR9 ligand in cord blood. Additionally, other factors, such as maternal age and parity should be taken into consideration when analysing foetal/neonatal innate immune responses.
   Conclusion: These data advocate a possible mechanism by which PAM may modulate foetal/neonatal innate immunity.

TI Managing insecticide resistance in malaria vectors by combining
   carbamate-treated plastic wall sheeting and pyrethroid-treated bed nets

ID CULEX-QUINQUEFASCIATUS MOSQUITOS; ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE S.S.; COTE-DIVOIRE;

   EFFICACY; CULICIDAE; DIPTERA
AB Background: Pyrethroid resistance is now widespread in Anopheles gambiae, the major vector for malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. This resistance may compromise malaria vector control strategies that are currently in use in endemic areas. In this context, a new tool for management of resistant mosquitoes based on the combination of a pyrethroid-treated bed net and carbamate-treated plastic sheeting was developed.
   Methods: In the laboratory, the insecticidal activity and wash resistance of four carbamate-treated materials: a cotton/polyester blend, a polyvinyl chloride tarpaulin, a cotton/polyester blend covered on one side with polyurethane, and a mesh of polypropylene fibres was tested. These materials were treated with bendiocarb at 100 mg/m(2) and 200 mg/m(2) with and without a binding resin to find the best combination for field studies. Secondly, experimental hut trials were performed in southern Benin to test the efficacy of the combined use of a pyrethroid-treated bed net and the carbamate-treated material that was the most wash-resistant against wild populations of pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus.
   Results: Material made of polypropylene mesh (PPW) provided the best wash resistance (up to 10 washes), regardless of the insecticide dose, the type of washing, or the presence or absence of the binding resin. The experimental hut trial showed that the combination of carbamate-treated PPW and a pyrethroid-treated bed net was extremely effective in terms of mortality and inhibition of blood feeding of pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae. This efficacy was found to be proportional to the total surface of the walls. This combination showed a moderate effect against wild populations of Cx. quinquefasciatus, which were strongly resistant to pyrethroid.
   Conclusion: These preliminary results should be confirmed, including evaluation of entomological, parasitological, and clinical parameters. Selective pressure on resistance mechanisms within the vector population, effects on other pest insects, and the acceptability of this management strategy in the community also need to be evaluated.

AB Many societies use locally sourced mosquito nets made from a variety of materials. For protecting against malaria these require regular re-treatment with insecticide. K-O Tab 1-2-3 is a 'dip-it-yourself' long-lasting formulation with time-limited interim recommendation from WHO for treatment of washed white and coloured polyester nets for up to 15 washes.
   To determine wash-resistance on different fabrics, nets made of polyester, polyethylene, cotton or nylon were treated with K-O Tab 1-2-3 and washed up to 20 times using standard WHO washing procedures. Efficacy was assessed using cone and cylinder bioassays and tunnel tests, and deltamethrin content using high-pressure liquid chromatography.
   Polyethylene and cotton nets treated with K-O Tab 1-2-3 and washed 20 times achieved the WHO threshold of >80% mortality in tunnel tests. Polyethylene matched the performance of polyester in all bioassays in contrast to cotton and nylon which produced low mortality and knock-down in cone and cylinder bioassays. After 20 washes 16.5% of the loading dose of deltamethrin remained on the polyester nets compared with 28.7% on polyethylene, 38.9% on cotton and 2.2% on nylon. Cotton nets retained a high concentration of insecticide but the relatively poor performance in terms of knock-down and mortality suggest most insecticide is bound within the cotton fibres rather than on the surface.
   K-O Tab 1-2-3 renders insecticide wash fast on polyethylene nets, less so on cotton and nylon. Nets made from polyethylene can be treated in the home to render the insecticide long lasting. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. In the context of the increasing resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), we evaluated the efficacy of mefloquine (MQ) for intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp).
   Methods. A multicenter, open-label equivalence trial was conducted in Benin from July 2005 through April 2008. Women of all gravidities were randomized to receive SP (1500 mg of sulfadoxine and 75 mg of pyrimethamine) or 15 mg/kg MQ in a single intake twice during pregnancy. The primary end point was the proportion of low birth-weight (LBW) infants (body weight, <2500 g; equivalence margin, 5%).
   Results. A total of 1601 women were randomized to receive MQ (n = 802) or SP (n = 799). In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, which assessed only live singleton births, 59 (8%) of 735 women who were given MQ and 72 (9.8%) of 730 women who were given SP gave birth to LBW infants (difference between low birth weights in treatment groups, -1.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.8% to 1.1%]), establishing equivalence between the drugs. The per-protocol analysis showed consistent results. MQ was more efficacious than SP in preventing placental malaria (prevalence, 1.7% vs 4.4% of women; P = .005), clinical malaria (incidence rate, 26 cases/10,000 person-months vs. 68 cases/10,000 person-months; P = .007), and maternal anemia at delivery (as defined by a hemoglobin level <10 g/dL) (prevalence, 16% vs 20%; marginally significant at P = .09). Adverse events (mainly vomiting, dizziness, tiredness, and nausea) were more commonly associated with the use of MQ (prevalence, 78% vs 32%; P < 10(-3)). One woman in the MQ group had severe neuropsychiatric symptoms.
   Conclusions. MQ proved to be highly efficacious-both clinically and parasitologically-for use as IPTp. However, its low tolerability might impair its effectiveness and requires further investigations.

TI PfHRP2 and PfLDH antigen detection for monitoring the efficacy of

AB Background: An assessment of the accuracy of two malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) or Pf lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) was undertaken in children aged between six and 59 months included in an anti-malarial efficacy study in Benin.
   Methods: In Allada (Benin), 205 children aged 6-59 months with falciparum malaria received either artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). Children included in the study were simultaneously followed by both RDT and high-quality microscopy for up to 42 days.
   Results: At the time of inclusion, PfHRP2-based tests were positive in 203 children (99%) and PfLDH-based tests were positive in 204 (99.5%). During follow-up, independent of the treatment received, only 17.3% (28/162) of children effectively cured were negative with the PfHRP2 RDT at day 3, with a gradual increase in specificity until day 42. The specificity of antigen detection with the PfLDH test was 87% (141/162) on day 3, and between 92% and 100% on days 7 to 42. A statistical difference was observed between the persistence of PfHRP2 and PfLDH antigenaemia during follow-up in children treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) but not with SP.
   Conclusion: Although both RDTs are as sensitive as microscopy in detecting true malaria cases, the PfHRP2 RDT had very low specificity during follow-up until day 28. On the other hand, the PfLDH test could be used to detect failures and, therefore, to assess anti-malarial efficacy.
