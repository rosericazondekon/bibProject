TI Screening of pesticide residues in soil and water samples from

ID ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE COMPLEX; IMPREGNATED BEDNETS; RESISTANCE;
   IDENTIFICATION; PYRETHROIDS; S.S
AB Background: The role of agricultural practices in the selection of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has so far been hypothesized without clear evidence. Many mosquito species, Anopheles gambiae in particular, lay their eggs in breeding sites located around agricultural settings. There is a probability that, as a result of farming activities, insecticide residues may be found in soil and water, where they exercise a selection pressure on the larval stage of various populations of mosquitoes. To confirm this hypothesis, a study was conducted in the Republic of Benin to assess the environmental hazards which can be generated from massive use of pesticides in agricultural settings.
   Methods: Lacking an HPLC machine for direct quantification of insecticide residues in samples, this investigation was performed using indirect bioassays focussed on the study of factors inhibiting the normal growth of mosquito larvae in breeding sites. The speed of development was monitored as well as the yield of rearing An. gambiae larvae in breeding sites reconstituted with water and soil samples collected in agricultural areas known to be under pesticide pressure. Two strains of An. gambiae were used in this indirect bioassay: the pyrethroid-susceptible Kisumu strain and the resistant Ladji strain. The key approach in this methodology is based on comparison of the growth of larvae in test and in control breeding sites, the test samples having been collected from two vegetable farms.
   Results: Results obtained clearly show the presence of inhibiting factors on test samples. A normal growth of larvae was observed in control samples. In breeding sites simulated by using a few grams of soil samples from the two vegetable farms under constant insecticide treatments ( test samples), a poor hatching rate of Anopheles eggs coupled with a retarded growth of larvae and a low yield of adult mosquitoes from hatched eggs, was noticed.
   Conclusion: Toxic factors inhibiting the hatching of anopheles eggs and the growth of larvae are probably pesticide residues from agricultural practices. Samples used during this indirect assay have been stored in the laboratory and will be analysed with HPLC techniques to confirm hypothesis of this study and to identify the various end products found in soil and water samples from agricultural settings under pesticide pressure.

AB Among the characteristics of spinosad that are worth noting is its environmentally favorable toxicity profile. It is a compound of biological origin, whose insecticide action is highly effective against a great number of insects. Laboratory larval bioassays of spinosad on Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Anopheles gainbiae (specimens that were either susceptible or resistant to pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates) showed that this product had a lethal action (mortality after 24 h of exposure) regardless of the original status, susceptible or resistant, of the mosquito larvae.

TI Evaluation of KO-Tab 1-2-3 (R): a wash-resistant 'dip-it-yourself'
   insecticide formulation for long-lasting treatment of mosquito nets
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID FIELD
AB Introduction: Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are an important method of preventing malaria. To remain effective, they need to be re-treated with pyrethroid insecticide at approximately yearly intervals. Systems for re-treating nets in Africa are limited, and the vast majority of nets in use have never been treated or were treated only once. Bayer Environmental Science (BES) has developed a long-lasting formulation 'KO-Tab1-2-3(R)' which can be applied to the net post-manufacture, under field conditions, and renders the insecticide wash-resistant.
   Methods: The performance of polyester nets treated with three kinds of BES long-lasting formulations, a conventional ITN ( treated with standard KO-Tab) and PermaNet 2.0 were evaluated after washing samples of treated netting up to 30 times using standard WHO procedures. Performance was measured using 'three-minute exposure' and 'median time to knockdown' bioassay tests and by measuring the levels of deltamethrin using high-pressure liquid chromatography.
   Results: The conventional ITN was largely stripped of deltamethrin within 5-10 washes and insecticidal efficacy in bioassay declined to suboptimal levels. With PermaNet and KO-Tab 1-2-3 the loss of deltamethrin was much slower: insecticide content halved within 20 washes and there was no loss of biological efficacy in three-minute exposure bioassays in WHO cylinders even after 30 washes. After 30 washes there remained on the netting 16% (4.4 mg/m(2)) of the loading dose of KO-Tab 1-2-3 and 28% (18.8 mg/m(2)) of the loading dose of PermaNet.
   Conclusion: KO-Tab 1-2-3 was confirmed to be a long-lasting insecticide formulation. This finding raises the prospect of conventional polyester nets being converted into long-lasting insecticidal nets through simple dipping in the community or at home. This single development, if widely adopted, could transform the malaria control landscape in Africa and have a major impact on malaria.

TI Rapid urban malaria appraisal (RUMA) in sub-Saharan Africa
SO MALARIA JOURNAL

DT Article

   SENEGAL; EXAMPLE; DAKAR; MORBIDITY; MORTALITY
AB Background: The rapid urban malaria appraisal (RUMA) methodology aims to provide a cost-effective tool to conduct rapid assessments of the malaria situation in urban sub-Saharan Africa and to improve the understanding of urban malaria epidemiology.
   Methods: This work was done in Yopougon municipality ( Abidjan), Cotonou, Dar es Salaam and Ouagadougou. The study design consists of six components: 1) a literature review, 2) the collection of available health statistics, 3) a risk mapping, 4) school parasitaemia surveys, 5) health facility-based surveys and 6) a brief description of the health care system. These formed the basis of a multi-country evaluation of RUMA's feasibility, consistency and usefulness.
   Results: A substantial amount of literature ( including unpublished theses and statistics) was found at each site, providing a good overview of the malaria situation. School and health facility-based surveys provided an overview of local endemicity and the overall malaria burden in different city areas. This helped to identify important problems for in-depth assessment, especially the extent to which malaria is over-diagnosed in health facilities. Mapping health facilities and breeding sites allowed the visualization of the complex interplay between population characteristics, health services and malaria risk. However, the latter task was very time-consuming and required special expertise. RUMA is inexpensive, costing around 8,500 - 13,000 USD for a six to ten-week period.
   Conclusion: RUMA was successfully implemented in four urban areas with different endemicity and proved to be a cost-effective first approach to study the features of urban malaria and provide an evidence basis for planning control measures.

AB Although pyrethroid-treated materials are a promising tool for the prevention and the control of dengue in the tropics. the development of pyrethroid resistance in the main mosquito vector (Aedes aegypti) may negate their use for personal and/or community protection. In that context, the efficacy of a mixture of a repellent (N,N-diethyl toluamide [DEET]) and a non-pyrethroid insecticide (propoxur) was investigated under laboratory conditions against both pyrethroid-susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes with the knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation. The results showed that a combination of propoxur and DEET induced a knockdown effect and mortality as high as deltamethrin (a standard pyrethroid) against the susceptible strain, and significantly higher efficacy against the pyrethroid-resistant strain. This could be explained mainly by the existence of a strong synergistic interaction between DEET and propoxur in mosquitoes. This study constitutes a first step towards an alternative strategy for improving mosquito control in areas with pyrethroid resistance.

AB The efficacy of a binary mixture of bifenthrin (pyrethroid) and chlorpyrifos-methyl (organophosphate) has been tested against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae Giles, the major malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa. Dose-mortality regression lines were determined for each insecticide alone and in mixtures by topical applications on adult female mosquitoes. A combination index (CI) was used to quantify the interactions occurring between the pyrethroid and organophosphate insecticides. The results revealed synergism at high doses against both susceptible (0.7 > CI > 0.3) and pyrethroid-resistant (0.9 > CI > 0.7) An. gambiae. These results suggest that insecticide mixtures may be an alternative strategy for vector control, especially in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to pyrethroids.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Background: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are an integral component of malaria control programmes in Africa. How much pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors will impact on the efficacy of ITNs is controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate knockdown and killing effects of ITNs on a metabolic-based resistant or tolerant malaria vector strain.
   Methods: Bio-efficacy of 500 mg/m(2) permethrin EC treated bednets was assessed on the OCEAC laboratory (OC-Lab) strain of Anopheles gambiae s.s.. This strain is resistant to DDT and tolerant to pyrethroids, with elevated mixed function oxidases. The Kisumu reference susceptible strain of A. gambiae s.s. was used as control. Nets were impregnated in February 1998 and used by households of the Ebogo village. Then they were collected monthly over six months for Bio-assays ( WHO cone test). Knockdown and mortality rates were compared between the OC-Lab and the Kisumu strains, by means of the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test.
   Results: During the whole trial, permethrin EC knockdown rates were impressive ( mostly higher than 97%). No significant difference was observed between the two strains. However, the mortality rates were significantly decreased in the OC-Lab strain ( 40 - 80%) compared with that of the Kisumu strain ( 75 - 100%). The decrease of killing effect on the OC-Lab strain was attributed to permethrin EC tolerance, due to the high oxidase metabolic activity.
   Conclusion: These data suggested an impact of pyrethroid tolerance on the residual activity of ITNs. More attention should be given to early detection of resistance using biochemical or molecular assays for better resistance management.

AB Accumulative indirect evidence of the epidemiology of Mycobacterium ulcerans infections causing chronic skin ulcers (i.e., Buruli ulcer disease) suggests that the development of this pathogen and its transmission to humans are related predominantly to aquatic environments. We report that snails could transitorily harbor M. ulcerans without offering favorable conditions for its growth and replication. A novel intermediate link in the transmission chain of M. ulcerans becomes likely with predator aquatic insects in addition to phytophage insects. Water bugs, such as Naucoris cimicoides, a potential vector of M. ulcerans, were shown to be infected specifically by this bacterium after feeding on snails experimentally exposed to M. ulcerans.

AB Malaria is one of the first pandemic diseases and represents a major problem of public health, particularly in Africa. In Benin, the screening of traditional medicine is susceptible, as that was the case with artemisinine in China, to open new ways for new drugs discovery. This study presents an in vitro evaluation of the antiplasmodial effects of extracts from four plants commonly used in Benin as folk medicine against malaria. It concerns ethanol, methanol and methylene chloride extracts of Argemone mexicana, Cassia rotundifolia, Phyllanthus amarus and of Thalia geniculata. Most of these extracts show significant activity against the chloroquine-sensitive strain of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7. (C) 2004 Academic des sciences. Publie par Elsevier SAS. Tous droits reserves.

AB Background: The evolution and spread of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.s, the major malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa, is of great concern owing to the importance of pyrethroid-treated nets in the WHO global strategy for malaria control. The impact of kdr(the main pyrethroid-resistance mechanism) on the behaviour of An. gambiae is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether high or low doses of permethrin differ in their resistance-selection effects.
   Methods: The effect of permethrin treatment was assessed under laboratory conditions using the tunnel test technique against susceptible, heterozygous and homozygous genotypes. Experimental huts trials were then carried out in Benin to assess the level of personal protection conferred by nets treated with a variety of permethrin concentrations and their impact on the selection for kdr allele.
   Results: Tunnel tests showed that nets treated with permethrin at 250 and 500 mg/m(2) induced higher mortality and blood feeding reduction among susceptible and heterozygous (RS) females as compared to the lower concentration (100 mg/m(2)). The experimental hut trials showed that the best personal protection was achieved with the highest permethrin concentration (1,000 mg/m(2)). Mosquito genotyping revealed a non-linear relationship in the survival of kdr susceptible and resistant genotypes with permethrin dosage. Higher dosages (greater than or equal to250 mg/m(2)) killed more efficiently the RS genotypes than did lower dosages (50 and 100 mg/m(2)).
   Conclusion: This study showed that nets treated with high permethrin concentrations provided better blood feeding prevention against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae than did lower concentrations. Permethrin-treated nets seem unlikely to select for pyrethroid resistance in areas where the kdr mutation is rare and present mainly in heterozygous form.

ID HEALTH-SERVICES; DEMAND; PHILIPPINES; ILLNESS; REGION
AB Malaria represents a major health problem with over I million annual deaths in Africa alone. There are a limited number of policies tackling the health problems of people at greater risk, namely the poor and rural communities. This is partly due to the lack of evidence available on the range of factors affecting their health status. Despite endemic malarial situations, there is still little understanding of the relative importance of economic factors that contribute to people acquiring malaria. This paper examines the socio-economic and economic factors that affect the incidence of malaria in rural community households in Benin, where malaria is endemic.
   A sample of 1585 households was determined to collect information on socio-economic characteristics and the presence of malaria symptoms. Probit estimation techniques were used to assess the impact of socio-demographic and socio-economic factors on the incidence of malaria, comparing households with and without malaria patients.
   Predisposing characteristics of the household head Such as age, knowledge of malaria, education and the size of the household significantly affect the incidence of malaria as anticipated by economic theory. Enabling factors reflecting higher economic status, measured by monthly expenditure and a socio-economic index, have a statistically significant and positive impact on the incidence of malaria. This could reflect that better-off have improved case reporting and are likely to seek treatment. Variations in socioeconomic and economic characteristics are significant in explaining the incidence of malaria, even in an endemic malarial setting. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB High insecticide resistance resulting from insensitive acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has emerged in mosquitoes. A single mutation (G119S of the ace-1 gene) explains this high resistance in Culex pipiens and in Anopheles gambiae. In order to provide better documentation of the ace-1 gene and the effect of the G119S mutation, we present a three-dimension structure model of AChE, showing that this unique substitution is localized in the oxyanion hole, explaining the insecticide insensitivity and its interference with the enzyme catalytic functions. As the G119S creates a restriction site, a simple PCR test was devised to detect its presence in both A. gambiae and C. pipiens, two mosquito species belonging to different subfamilies (Culicinae and Anophelinae). It is possibile that this mutation also explains the high resistance found in other mosquitoes, and the present results indicate that the PCR test detects the G119S mutation in the malaria vector A. albimanus. The G119S has thus occurred independently at least four times in mosquitoes and this PCR test is probably of broad applicability within the Culicidae family.

AB Twenty extracts from nine Benin medicinal plants, traditionally used to treat malaria, were screened for in vitro antiplasmodial activity towards Plasmodium falciparum K1 chloroquine resistant and 3D7 chloroquine sensitive strains. All plants showed antiplasmodial activity below 10 mug/ml. Nine extracts exhibited IC50 Values below 5 mug/ml towards one or both of the two strains. The most active extract towards the sensitive 3D7 strain was the methanolic extract of Croton lobatus aerial part, with an IC50 value of 0.38 mug/ml. The best inhibition of the growth of Plasmodium falciparum resistant K1 strain was observed with the methylene chloride extract of Hybanthus enneaspermus and with the methanolic extract of Croton lobatus roots (IC50 = 2.57 and 2.80 mug/ml, respectively).

AB We investigate the two-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm operator H-c0,H-beta = (-idel - A)(2) - betadelta((.) - Gamma), where Gamma is a smooth loop and A is the vector potential which corresponds to the Aharonov-Bohm potential. The asymptotics of negative eigenvalues of H-c0,H-beta for beta --> +infinity is found. We also prove that for large enough positive value of the system exhibits persistent currents.

AB A site-based characterization of Plasmodium falciparum infections in children living in two malaria hyperendemic urban areas from West and Central Africa was undertaken. A total of 58 and 46 children with either asymptomatic infections or uncomplicated (symptomatic) malaria were recruited in Gabon and Benin, respectively. Parasite density, hematological factors, the genetic diversity of P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2) and the complexity of infections (mean number of P. falciparum genotypes per infected child) were used for this characterization. Gabonese children with uncomplicated malaria presented a higher mean axillary temperature (39.2 vs 38.6, P=0.004) and a higher geometric mean parasite density (30,538 vs 18,921, P<0.001) associated with a significantly lower hemoglobin level (P<0.01). A higher degree of msp2 polymorphism and the complexity of P. falciparum infections were also observed in children from Gabon (P<0.05). With a similar level of malaria transmission in both urban sites, these results suggest an impact of malaria control interventions on the dynamics of concurrent P. falciparum infections.

ID CHILDHOOD ILLNESS; MANAGEMENT
AB Background In developing countries, health workers often do not follow clinical practice guidelines. However, few studies have examined why different types of errors occur.
   Methods We analysed a sample of consultations of children with non-severe malaria (defined as fever without signs of severe illness) from a health facility survey conducted in Oueme Departement, Benin. Treatment was defined as correct (recommended antimalarial), a minor error (non-recommended antimalarial), or a major error (no antimalarial).
   Results In all, 85 health workers and 289 children were studied. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with major errors: treatment by a physician (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 13.57, 95% CI: 1.45-126.75), child's age <12 months (aOR = 3.41, 95% CI: 1.15-10.07), and child's temperature (aOR = 0.58 per degreesC, 95% CI: 0.34-0.97). Factors significantly associated with minor errors were: child's temperature (aOR = 1.43 per degreesC, 95% CI: 1.07-1.92), electricity at the health facility (aOR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.05-9.17), greater than or equal to1 supervision visit in the past 6 months (aOR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.14-0.77), fever treatment wall chart in the consultation room (aOR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12-0.73), and number of non-fever chief complaints (aOR = 0.67 per complaint, 95% CI: 0.48-0.93). In-service training in malaria treatment was not significantly associated with either error type.
   Conclusions Many factors may influence health worker performance, and factors such as pre-service training may influence performance in unexpected ways. Identifying different errors and analysing them separately can help reveal potential causes that may be masked by combining errors into a single category.
