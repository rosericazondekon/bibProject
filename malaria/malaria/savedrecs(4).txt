AB Due to the rapid extension of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors worldwide, manufacturers are developing new vector control tools including insecticide mixtures containing at least two active ingredients with different mode of action as part of insecticide resistance management. Olyset (R) Plus is a new long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) incorporating permethrin and a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), into its fibres in order to counteract metabolic-based pyrethroid resistance of mosquitoes. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Olyset (R) Plus both in laboratory and field against susceptible and multi-resistant malaria vectors and compared with Olyset (R) Net, which is a permethrin incorporated into polyethylene net. In laboratory, Olyset (R) Plus performed better than Olyset (R) Net against susceptible Anopheles gambiae strain with a 2-day regeneration time owing to an improved permethrin bleeding rate with the new incorporation technology. It also performed better than Olyset (R) Net against multiple resistant populations of An. gambiae in experimental hut trials in West Africa. Moreover, the present study showed evidence for a benefit of incorporating a synergist, PBO, with a pyrethroid insecticide into mosquito netting. These results need to be further validated in a large-scale field trial to assess the durability and acceptability of this new tool for malaria vector control.

AB Insecticides from the organophosphate (OP) and pyrethroid (PY) chemical families, have respectively, been in use for 50 and 30 years in West Africa, mainly against agricultural pests, but also against vectors of human disease. The selection pressure, with practically the same molecules year after year (mainly on cotton), has caused insecticide resistance in pest populations such as Bemisia tabaci, vector of harmful phytoviruses on vegetables. The evolution toward insecticide resistance in malaria vectors such as Anopheles gambiae sensus lato (s.l.) is probably related to the current use of these insecticides in agriculture. Thus, successful pest and vector control in West Africa requires an investigation of insect susceptibility, in relation to the identification of species and sub species, such as molecular forms or biotypes. Identification of knock down resistance (kdr) and acetylcholinesterase gene (Ace 1) mutations modifying insecticide targets in individual insects and measure of enzymes activity typically involved in insecticide metabolism (oxidase, esterase and glutathion-S-transferase) are indispensable in understanding the mechanisms of resistance. Insecticide resistance is a good example in which genotype phenotype links have been made successfully. Insecticides used in agriculture continue to select new resistant populations of B. tabaci that could be from different biotype vectors of plant viruses. As well, the evolution of insecticide resistance in An. gambiae threatens the management of malaria vectors in West Africa. It raises the question of priority in the use of insecticides in health and/or agriculture, and more generally, the question of sustainability of crop protection and vector control strategies in the region. Here, we review the susceptibility tests, biochemical and molecular assays data for B. tabaci, a major pest in cotton and vegetable crops, and An. gambiae, main vector of malaria. The data reviewed was collected in Benin and Burkina Faso between 2008 and 2010 under the Corus 6015 research program. This review aims to show: (i) the insecticide resistance in B. tabaci as well as in An. gambiae; and (ii) due to this, the impact of selection of resistant populations on malaria vector control strategies. Some measures that could be beneficial for crop protection and vector control strategies in West Africa are proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Identification of the major loci responsible for insecticide resistance in malaria vectors would aid the development and implementation of effective resistance management strategies, which are urgently needed to tackle the growing threat posed by resistance to the limited insecticides available for malaria control. Genome-wide association studies in the major malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, have been hindered by the high degree of within-population structuring and very low levels of linkage disequilibrium hence we revisited the use of quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to study resistance phenotypes in this vector species. Earlier work, identified two major QTL associated with pyrethroid resistance in A. gambiae s.s. from East Africa using genetic crossing of laboratory-colonized resistant and susceptible strains. In this study, we report the results from genetic mapping of pyrethroid resistance in three isofemale pedigrees established from wild-caught female A. gambiae s.s. mosquitoes from Benin. We identified two QTL on chromosomes 2L and 3R in these field populations, in similar genomic locations to the QTL identified in laboratory strains. The relative merits of two alternative study designs are discussed and suggestions made for future genetic mapping studies of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes.

AB Background: VAR2CSA is a large polymorphic Plasmodium falciparum protein expressed on infected erythrocytes (IE) that allows their binding in the placenta, thus precipitating placental malaria (PM). The N-terminal part of VAR2CSA that contains the binding site to placental chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) is currently recognized as the most attractive region for vaccine development. An ultimate challenge is to define epitopes in this region that induce a broad cross-reactive adhesion inhibitory antibody response.
   Methods: Based on phylogenetic data that identified a dimorphic sequence motif in the VAR2CSA DBL2X, we raised antibodies against the NTS-DBL2X constructs containing one sequence or the other (3D7 and FCR3) and tested their functional properties on P. falciparum isolates from pregnant women and on laboratory-adapted strains.
   Results: The CSA binding inhibitory capacity of the antibodies induced varied from one parasite isolate to another (range, 10%-100%), but the combined analysis of individual activity highlighted a broader functionality that increased the total number of isolates inhibited. Interestingly, the differential inhibitory effect of the antibodies observed on field isolates resulted in significant inhibition of all field isolates tested, suggesting that optimal inhibitory spectrum on field isolates from pregnant women might be achieved with antibodies targeting limited variants of the N-terminal VAR2CSA.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the NTS-DBL2X region of VAR2CSA can elicit strain-transcending anti-adhesion antibodies and suggest that the combination of the two major variants used here could represent the basis for an effective bivalent VAR2CSA-based vaccine.

AB Background: The M and S molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s. Giles appear to have speciated in West Africa and the M form is now formally named An. coluzzii Coetzee & Wilkerson sp.n. and the S form retains the nominotypical name (abbreviated here to An. gambiae). Reproductive isolation is thought to be the main barrier to hybridisation; even though both species are found in the same mating swarms, hybrid fertilisations in copulae have not been found in the study area. The aim of the study, therefore, was to determine whether differences in circadian and/or environmental control over the timing of swarming in the two species contribute to reproductive isolation.
   Methods: The timing of male swarming in these species was recorded four nights per month over four years at five swarming sites in each of two villages. The timing of the start and end of swarming, and the concurrent environmental parameters, temperature, humidity and light intensity, were recorded for n = 20 swarms/month/species. The timing of 'spontaneous' activity at dusk of individual An. coluzzii and An. gambiae males was video-recorded in an actograph outdoors for 21 nights.
   Results: Of the environmental parameters considered, swarming was most strongly correlated with sunset (r(2) > 0.946). Anopheles gambiae started and stopped swarming earlier than An. coluzzii (3:35 +/- 0:68 min:sec and 4:51 +/- 1:21, respectively), and the mean duration of swarming was 23:37 +/- 0:33 for An. gambiae and 21:39 +/- 0:33 for An. coluzzii. Accordingly, in principle, whenever both species swarm over the same marker, a mean of 15.3 +/- 3.1% of An. gambiae swarming would occur before An. coluzzii males arrived, and 19.5 +/- 4.55% of An. coluzzii swarming would occurred after An. gambiae males had stopped swarming. These results are consistent with the finding that An. gambiae males became active in the actograph 09:35 +/- 00:22 min:sec earlier than An. coluzzii males.
   Conclusions: The timing of swarming and spontaneous activity at dusk are primarily under circadian control, with the phase linked closely to sunset throughout the year. The mating activity of these two species is temporally segregated for 15-20% of the swarming period, which may contribute to the observed reproductive isolation of these species in local sympatric populations.

AB Background: With the rapid spread of pyrethroid resistance in the main malaria vectors from Benin and the various resistance mechanisms involved (metabolic resistance and knock-down resistance (kdr), it is important to foresee effective resistance management strategies. Thus, the knowledge of the insensitive acetylcholinesterase (ace-1R) effects on phenotypes of An. gambiae will help us to strengthen basic and operational research on the development of strategies that will use organophosphates or carbamates as alternatives against pyrethroids-resistant malaria vectors in the field.
   Methods: Larvae and pupae of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes were collected from the breeding sites in Oueme, Atacora, and Alibori departments. CDC susceptibility tests were conducted on unfed female mosquitoes aged 2-5 days old. CDC bioassays were performed with stock solutions of fenitrothion (50 mu g per bottle) and bendiocarb (12.5 mu g per bottle). PCR techniques were used to detect species and Ace-1 mutations.
   Results: Anopheles gambiae Seme and Kandi populations were susceptible to fenitrothion whereas Anopheles gambiae Tanguieta and Malanville populations were resistant. An. gambiae populations from Seme, Kandi and Malanville were fully susceptible to bendiocarb whereas those from Tanguieta have developed a strong resistance to the same insecticide. A slight decrease in mortality rate was observed with 97.91% in populations of mosquitoes from Malanville. PCR revealed that all specimens tested were Anopheles gambiae s.s.. The presence of Ace-1R at very low frequency (0.01) was observed in Anopheles gambiae Malanville populations.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated the need to monitor organophosphate (OPs) and Carbamates resistance among populations of the An. gambiae s.l. in Benin, to determine its spread and anticipate vector control failure where these insecticides are used. However, further studies are needed to understand the current distribution of the Ace-1R mutation in other localities in the south-north transect Benin.

AB Background: In Benin, around four million Long-Lasting Insecticide-treated Nets were freely distributed to household to prevent malaria in 2011. In contrast to a previous campaign that targeted only children under 5 years and pregnant women, this distribution campaign was conducted in order to achieve universal coverage. This study presents the results of LLIN coverage and utilization after the distribution campaign.
   Methods: The study was a cross-sectional household survey which utilized a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design. The strata represented the twelve departments covered by the national distribution campaign in 2011 and included a total of 4,800 households randomly selected in the country. A questionnaire adapted from the standard Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) Household Questionnaire was used. Data were entered using QPS software and analyzed with R 2.14.1.
   Results: LLIN ownership was 86.4% (74 - 94). On average, each household received 3 LLINs (2-4). The proportion of households that met the ratio one net for two persons was 77%. The proportions of individuals sleeping under LLINs were high (84.8%). LLIN use among urban residents was 10% lower than in effective users from rural areas (P = 0.00224).
   Conclusions: The universal distribution campaign conducted in Benin has increased LLIN ownership and use in the community. But additional efforts are need to improve and maintain LLIN coverage.

AB The molecular form composition of Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) mating swarms and the associated mating pairs (copulae) were investigated during two rainy seasons (July to October, 2005 and July to November, 2006) in the villages of Soumousso and Vallee du Kou (VK7). Although the habitats of these villages differ markedly, sympatric populations of M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. occur in both places periodically. The main aim was to assess the degree to which these molecular forms mate assortatively. In Soumousso, a wooded savannah habitat, the majority of swarm samples consisted of only S-form males (21/28), although a few M-form males were found in mixed M- and S-form swarms. In VK7, a rice growing area, the majority of swarm samples consisted of only M-form males (38/62), until October and November 2006, when there were nearly as many mixed-form as single-form swarms. Overall, approximate to 60% of M- and S-form swarms were temporally or spatially segregated; the two forms were effectively prevented from encountering each other. Of the remaining 40% of swarms, however, only about half were single-form and the rest were mixed-form. Of the 33 copulae collected from mixed-form swarms, only four were mixed-form pairs, significantly fewer than expected by random pairing between forms ((2) = 10.34, d.f. = 2, P < 0.01). Finally, all specimens of inseminated females were of the same form as the sperm contained within their spermatheca (n = 91), even for the four mixed-form copulae. These findings indicate that assortative mating occurs within mixed-form swarms, mediated most probably by close-range mate recognition cues.

AB Background: Studies indicate that physical damage to long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) occurs at a surprisingly rapid rate following net distribution. To what extent does such damage affect the impact of LLINs? Can vectors pass a compromised LLIN barrier to bite? Do more resistant vectors enter the insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) through holes?
   Methods: The study was carried out in three geo-locations. Two types of LLINs (polyester and polyethylene) with 'standardized' physical damage were compared with similarly damaged, but non-insecticidal (control) nets. The proportionate Holes Index (pHI) of each net was 276. Mosquitoes were captured inside the nets, identified taxonomically, and subjected to molecular analysis to estimate Knock-down resistance (Kdr) frequency.
   Results: The most commonly observed species was Anopheles gambiae, accounting for approximately 70% (1,076/1,550) of the total mosquitoes collected both in LLINs and non-insecticidal nets. When compared with controls, number of vectors captured in torn LLINs was significantly reduced. Nonetheless in a night, an average of 5 An. gambiae s.l could enter the damaged LLINs to bite. Similar numbers of resistant mosquitoes were collected in both LLINs and non-insecticidal (control) nets (p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: At a pHI of 276, man-vector contact was observed in torn LLINs. The insecticide at the surface of LLINs could only reduce the number of vectors. Resistant mosquitoes have opportunity to enter both non-insecticidal (control) nets and LLINs to bite.

AB Background: Malaria is a leading cause of mortality in southern Benin. The main causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, poses a threat on critical transfusions in pregnant women and children. This study's objective was to compare the performance of different malaria screening methods in blood donors in southern Benin, a malaria-endemic country.
   Methods: Blood from 2,515 voluntary blood donors in Benin was collected over a period of 10 months in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes, which were then classified according to extraction time: long rainy season, short dry season, short rainy season, and long dry season. Microscopic examination was used to count parasites. Parasite density (PD) was expressed as the number of parasites per mu L of blood. Pan Plasmodium pLDH detection was assessed by an ELISA-malaria antigen test. Using crude soluble P. falciparum antigens, an ELISA-malaria antibody test detected anti-Plasmodium antibodies.
   Results: Among the 2,515 blood donors (2,025 males and 488 females) screened, the rate of asymptomatic Plasmodium carriage was 295/2,515 (11.72%, 95% CI: 10.5-13.1%). Males had a higher infection rate (12.4%) than did females (8.8%). Parasite density was very low: between seven and 100 parasites per mu L of blood was reported in 80% of donors with parasitaemia. Three Plasmodium species were diagnosed: P. falciparum in 280/295 patients (95.0%), Plasmodium malariae in 14/295 (5.0%), and Plasmodium ovale in 1/295 (0.34%). Malaria prevalence in donors was higher during the rainy seasons (13.7%) compared with the dry seasons (9.9%). The use of a highly sensitive assay enabled pan Plasmodium pLDH detection in 966/2,515 (38.4%, 95% CI: 36.5%-40.3%). Malaria antibody prevalence was 1,859/2,515 (73.9%, 95% CI: 72.16-75.6%). Donors' antigenaemia and antibody levels varied significantly (P <0.05) over the course of the four seasons. The highest antigenaemia rate 323/630 (51.3%), was observed during the short rainy season, while the highest antibody prevalence, 751/886 (84.7%), was recorded during the long dry season.
   Conclusion: Blood donations infected with Plasmodium can transmit malaria to donation recipients. Malaria diagnostic methods are currently available, but the feasibility criteria for mass screening in endemic areas become preponderant. Detection of the pLDH antigen seems to be an adequate screening tool in endemic areas, for this antigen indicates parasite presence. Routine screening of all donated blood would prevent infected blood donations and reduce P. falciparum transmission in critical patients, such as children and pregnant women. This tool would also decrease medical prophylaxis in donation recipients and contribute to lower Plasmodium resistance.

AB Background: Insecticide resistance monitoring is essential to help national programmers to implement more effective and sustainable malaria control strategies in endemic countries. The current study aimed at an exploring the involvement of detoxifying enzymes in the insecticide phenotype resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.l. from Benin, in order to guide future malaria vector control interventions.
   Methods: Larvae and pupae of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes were collected from the breeding sites in Oueme, Atacora and Alibori provinces. CDC susceptibility tests were conducted on unfed female mosquitoes aged 2-5 days old. CDC bioassays were performed with stock solutions of permethrin (21.5 mu g per bottle), deltamethrin (12.5 mu g per bottle) and bendiocarb (12.5 mu g per bottle). CDC biochemical assays using synergists were also conducted to assess the metabolic resistance.
   Results: The susceptibility of Anopheles gambiae Agbalilame and Kandi populations to permethrin and deltamethrin respectively, increased significantly when synergized by PBO, suggesting an implication of mono-oxygenases in resistance of Anopheles gambiae s.l. to pyrethroid. Esterases may play a role in bendiocarb resistance in Anopheles gambiae Tanguieta.
   Conclusion: Synergists partially restored susceptibility to pyrethroid and carbamate insecticides and might help mitigate the impact of vector resistance in Anopheles gambiae Agbalilame, Kandi and Tanguieta populations. However, additional vector control tools are needed to further impact on malaria transmission in such settings. This will improve the implementation and management of future control programs against this important malaria vector in Benin and in Africa in general.

AB Protection from infections in early life relies extensively on innate immunity, but it is unknown whether and how maternal infections modulate infants' innate immune responses, thereby altering susceptibility to infections. Plasmodium falciparum causes pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM), and epidemiological studies have shown that PAM enhances infants' susceptibility to infection with P. falciparum. We investigated how PAM-mediated exposures in utero affect innate immune responses and their relationship with infection in infancy. In a prospective study of mothers and their babies in Benin, we investigated changes in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated cytokine responses related to P. falciparum infections. Whole-blood samples from 134 infants at birth and at 3, 6, and 12 months of age were stimulated with agonists specific for TLR3, TLR4, TLR7/8, and TLR9. TLR-mediated interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-10 production was robust at birth and then stabilized, whereas tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) responses were weak at birth and then increased. In multivariate analyses, maternal P. falciparum infections at delivery were associated with significantly higher TLR3-mediated IL-6 and IL-10 responses in the first 3 months of life (P<0.05) and with significantly higher TLR3-, TLR7/8-, and TLR9-mediated TNF-alpha responses between 6 and 12 months of age (P<0.05). Prospective analyses showed that higher TLR3- and TLR7/8-mediated IL-10 responses at birth were associated with a significantly higher risk of P. falciparum infection in infancy (P<0.05). Neonatal and infant intracellular TLR-mediated cytokine responses are conditioned by in utero exposure through PAM late in pregnancy. Enhanced TLR-mediated IL-10 responses at birth are associated with an increased risk of P. falciparum infection, suggesting a compromised ability to combat infection in early life.

AB Background: Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1) is a highly polymorphic adherence receptor expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes. Based on sequence homology PfEMP-1 variants have been grouped into three major groups A-C, the highly conserved VAR2CSA variants, and semi-conserved types defined by tandem runs of specific domains ("domain cassettes'' (DC)). The PfEMP-1 type expressed determines the adherence phenotype, and is associated with clinical outcome of infection.
   Methods: Parasite isolates from Beninese children or women presenting with, respectively, CM or PAM were collected along with samples from patients with uncomplicated malaria (UM). We assessed the transcript level of var genes by RT-qPCR and the expression of PfEMP-1 proteins by LC-MS/MS.
   Results: Var genes encoding DC8 and Group A PfEMP-1 were transcribed more often and at higher levels in cerebral malaria vs. uncomplicated malaria patients. LC-MS/MS identified peptides from group A, DC8 PfEMP-1 more frequently in cerebral malaria than in uncomplicated malaria and pregnancy-associated malaria samples.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to show association between PfEMP-1 subtype and disease outcome by direct analysis of parasites proteome. The results corroborate that group A and specifically the PfEMP-1 types DC8 are universally associated with cerebral malaria. This is a crucial observation for promoting studies on malaria pathogenesis.

TI A New Long-Lasting Indoor Residual Formulation of the Organophosphate
   Insecticide Pirimiphos Methyl for Prolonged Control of
   Pyrethroid-Resistant Mosquitoes: An Experimental Hut Trial in Benin

   EFFICACY
AB Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is widely used for malaria transmission control in sub-Saharan Africa. Resistance to pyrethroids in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae is a growing problem. There is an urgent need to develop long-lasting alternative insecticides to reduce selection pressure for pyrethroid resistance and to provide control with a single IRS application in countries with long transmission seasons.
   Methods: Two capsule suspension formulations (CS) of the organophosphate pirimiphos methyl were evaluated as IRS treatments in experimental huts in an area of Benin where the mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus are resistant to pyrethroids but susceptible to organophosphates. The CS formulations were tested alongside an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation of pirimiphos methyl and a CS formulation of the pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin.
   Results: The two CS formulations of pirimiphos methyl gave prolonged control of An. gambiae and Cx. quinquefasciatus. In cement huts application rates of 0.5 g/m(2) induced high mortality of An. gambiae for almost a year: overall mortality rates 87% (95% CI 82-91%) and 92% (95% CI 88-94%). In mud huts application rates of 1 g/m(2) induced high mortality of An. gambiae for 10 months: overall mortality rates 75% (95% CI 69-81%) and 76% (95% CI 68-83%). The EC formulation of pirimiphos methyl failed to control An. gambiae two months after spraying. The pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin demonstrated prolonged residual activity in bioassay tests but failed to control pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae that entered the huts. Pirimiphos methyl CS was highly active against Culex quinquefasciatus and gave control for 10 months in cement huts and 6 months in mud huts.
   Conclusion: Pirimiphos methyl CS (Actellic 300 CS) applied at 1 g/m(2) shows great promise for providing prolonged control of pyrethroid-resistant An gambiae and for delaying pyrethroid resistance. An alternative to DDT, giving year-round transmission control in sub-Saharan Africa is now a realistic prospect.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB Background: Evaluation of malaria sporozoite rates in the salivary glands of Anopheles gambiae is essential for estimating the number of infective mosquitoes, and consequently, the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). EIR is a key indicator for evaluating the risk of malaria transmission. Although the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for detecting the circumsporozoite protein (CSP-ELISA) is routinely used in the field, it presents several limitations. A multiplex PCR can also be used to detect the four species of Plasmodium in salivary glands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a real-time quantitative PCR in detecting and quantifying wild Plasmodium falciparum in the salivary glands of An. gambiae.
   Methods: Anopheles gambiae (n=364) were experimentally infected with blood from P. falciparum gametocyte carriers, and P. falciparum in the sporozoite stage were detected in salivary glands by using a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. The sensitivity and specificity of this qPCR were compared with the multiplex PCR applied from the Padley method. CSP-ELISA was also performed on carcasses of the same mosquitoes.
   Results: The prevalence of P. falciparum and the intensity of infection were evaluated using qPCR. This method had a limit of detection of six sporozoites per mu L based on standard curves. The number of P. falciparum genomes in the salivary gland samples reached 9,262 parasites/mu L (mean: 254.5; 95% CI: 163.5-345.6). The qPCR showed a similar sensitivity (100%) and a high specificity (60%) compared to the multiplex PCR. The agreement between the two methods was "substantial" (k = 0.63, P < 0.05). The number of P. falciparum-positive mosquitoes evaluated with the qPCR (76%), multiplex PCR (59%), and CSP-ELISA (83%) was significantly different (P < 0.005).
   Conclusions: The qPCR assay can be used to detect P. falciparum in salivary glands of An. gambiae. The qPCR is highly sensitive and is more specific than multiplex PCR, allowing an accurate measure of infective An. gambiae. The results also showed that the CSP-ELISA overestimates the sporozoite rate, detecting sporozoites in the haemolymph in addition to the salivary glands.

   INTENSITY; EXPOSURE; RISK; LIFE
AB According to several studies, infants whose mothers had a malaria-infected placenta (MIP) at delivery are at increased risk of a first malaria infection. Immune tolerance caused by intrauterine contact with the parasite could explain this phenomenon, but it is also known that infants who are highly exposed to Anopheles mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium are at greater risk of contracting malaria. Consequently, local malaria transmission must be taken into account to demonstrate the immune tolerance hypothesis. From data collected between 2007 and 2010 on 545 infants followed from birth to age 18 months in southern Benin, we compared estimates of the effect of MIP on time to first malaria infection obtained through different Cox models. In these models, MIP was adjusted for either 1) "village-like" time-independent exposure variables or 2) spatiotemporal exposure prediction derived from local climatic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Only the use of exposure prediction improved the model's goodness of fit (Bayesian Information Criterion) and led to clear conclusions regarding the effect of placental infection, whereas the models using the village-like variables were less successful than the univariate model. This demonstrated clearly the benefit of adequately taking transmission into account in cohort studies of malaria.

AB Host and Plasmodium interactions result in highly variable clinical phenotypes, partly explained by the nature and level of anti-malarial antibody response. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G can create a tolerogenic environment, allowing parasites to escape from anti-malarial immunity. We performed a family-based association study encompassing 483 Sereer individuals (261 children and their parents), and reported two independent signals at the HLA-G 3' untranslated region associated with antibody response to specific Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigens, previously associated with malaria protection: (i) +3010G together with +3142C with total IgG and IgG1 against GLURP and (ii) +3196G with IgG3 against MSP2. While these results require further investigation, they suggest for the first time a role of HLA-G in the regulation of humoral immune response in malaria.

AB Background: Owing to pyrethroid resistance in An. gambiae, the carbamate and organophosphate insecticides are currently regarded as alternatives or supplements to pyrethroids for use on mosquito net treatments. Resistance monitoring is therefore essential to investigate the susceptibility of An. gambiae s.l to these alternative products.
   Methods: Two to three day old adult female Anopheles mosquitoes were reared from larvae collected in the five districts (Kouande, Natitingou, Materi, Pehunco, Tanguieta) of the Atacora department. Mosquitoes were then exposed to WHO impregnated papers. The four treatments consisted of: carbamates (0.1% bendiocarb, 0.1% propoxur) and organophosphates (0.25% pirimiphosmethyl, 1% fenitrothion). PCR assays were run to determine the members of the An. gambiae complex, the molecular forms (M) and (S), as well as phenotypes for insensitive acetylcholinesterase (AChE1) due to ace-1(R) mutation.
   Results: Bioassays showed bendiocarb resistance in all populations of An. gambiae s.s. tested. Propoxur resistance was observed in Materi, Pehunco and Tanguieta, while it was suspected in Kouande and Natitingou. As for the organophosphates, susceptibility to pirimiphos-methyl was assessed in all populations. Fenitrothion resistance was detected in Kouande, Pehunco and Tanguieta, while it was suspected in Materi and Natitingou. The S-form was predominant in tested samples (94.44%). M and S molecular forms were sympatric but no M/S hybrids were detected. The ace-1R mutation was found in both S and M molecular forms with frequency from 3.6 to 12%. Although the homozygous resistant genotype was the most prevalent genotype among survivors, the genotypes could not entirely explain the bioassay results.
   Conclusion: Evidence of bendiocarb resistance in An. gambiae populations is a clear indication that calls for the implementation of insecticide resistance management strategies. The ace-1R mutation could not entirely explain the resistance to bendiocarb observed and is highly suggestive of involvement of other resistance mechanisms such as metabolic detoxification.

AB Standard entomological methods for evaluating the impact of vector control lack sensitivity in low-malaria-risk areas. The detection of human IgG specific to Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary antigen reflects a direct measure of human-vector contact. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a range of vector control measures (VCMs) in urban settings by using this biomarker approach. The study was conducted from October to December 2008 on 2,774 residents of 45 districts of urban Dakar. IgG responses to gSG6-P1 and the use of malaria VCMs highly varied between districts. At the district level, specific IgG levels significantly increased with age and decreased with season and with VCM use. The use of insecticide-treated nets, by drastically reducing specific IgG levels, was by far the most efficient VCM regardless of age, season or exposure level to mosquito bites. The use of spray bombs was also associated with a significant reduction of specific IgG levels, whereas the use of mosquito coils or electric fans/air conditioning did not show a significant effect. Human IgG response to gSG6-P1 as biomarker of vector exposure represents a reliable alternative for accurately assessing the effectiveness of malaria VCM in low-malaria-risk areas. This biomarker tool could be especially relevant for malaria control monitoring and surveillance programmes in low-exposure/low-transmission settings.

AB Background: Despite widespread parasite resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) its use for intermittent preventative treatment during pregnancy remains the policy in Benin and throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods: In a prospective study, 982 pregnant women were recruited in Benin and followed until delivery. The prevalence of point mutations in the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes associated with Plasmodium falciparum resistance to SP during consecutive antenatal visits was determined. Parasites clearance among women infected at SP intake was assessed by microscopy and PCR. Association between the persistence of parasites and malaria consequences, were investigated. Recurrent parasites were genotyped to identify recrudescences from re-infections.
   Results: The prevalence of pfdhfr/pfdhps quadruple mutants (triple pfdhfr + single pfdhps) was consistently above 80% while quintuple and sextuple mutants remained low. Importantly the higly mutated parasites apparently never included the two key mutations, pfdhfr 164 L or pfdhps 540E. Based on PCR results, SP failed to clear existing parasitaemia in half (48%) of the women who were infected at IPTp schedule. The frequency of recrudescence reached 76% after the second dose. Women with persistent parasitaemia had an increased prevalence of anaemia (P = 0.03).
   Conclusion: The data presented here, highlight the inability of SP to ensure optimal antiplasmodial protection in late pregnancy, and invite urgent consideration of an alternative drug or strategy.

AB Malaria represents one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in Africa. Variability in clinical presentation is partly due to host genetic polymorphisms. Among them, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II alleles may be responsible for malaria susceptibility; however less is known about the possible role of non classical HLA molecules. Among them, HLA-G is a tolerogenic molecule with immunomodulatory properties, which differs from classical HLA class I molecules by its lower genetic diversity, tissue expression and function. Although primarily associated with maternal-fetal tolerance, HLA-G is now known to be involved in a wide range of physiopathological conditions, such as tumor, autoimmunity, transplantation, inflammation and viral infection by suppressing the function of various immune cells. In this work, we present the first evidence of an association between HLA-G 3'UTR polymorphisms and malaria infection. More precisely, we showed that HLA-G polymorphisms are associated with asymptomatic infection through two parasitological phenotypes, the intensity of Plasmodium falciparum infection and the mean level of parasite density. The allele + 3187G and its haplotype (UTR-1, 14 bp-Del/3001C/3003T/3010G/3035C/3052C/3142C/3187G/3196C) was associated with lower level of infection under a dominant model, and the haplotype UTR-3 (Del/3001C/3003T/3010C/3035C/3152C/3142G/3187A/3196C) was associated with high levels of infection under a recessive model. In conclusion, although further investigations are on the way to better address the possible involvement of the HLA-G molecule in the control of P. falciparum infection, this work presents the first evidence of an association between HLA-G polymorphisms and malaria infection. Further investigations are on the way to take into account the particularities of African populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The widespread insecticide resistance raises concerns for vector control implementation and sustainability particularly for the control of the main vector of human malaria, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. However, the extent to which insecticide resistance mechanisms interfere with the development of the malignant malaria parasite in its vector and their impact on overall malaria transmission remains unknown. We explore the impact of insecticide resistance on the outcome of Plasmodium falciparum infection in its natural vector using three An. gambiae strains sharing a common genetic background, one susceptible to insecticides and two resistant, one homozygous for the ace-1(R) mutation and one for the kdr mutation. Experimental infections of the three strains were conducted in parallel with field isolates of P. falciparum from Burkina Faso (West Africa) by direct membrane feeding assays. Both insecticide resistant mutations influence the outcome of malaria infection by increasing the prevalence of infection. In contrast, the kdr resistant allele is associated with reduced parasite burden in infected individuals at the oocyst stage, when compared to the susceptible strain, while the ace-1(R) resistant allele showing no such association. Thus insecticide resistance, which is particularly problematic for malaria control efforts, impacts vector competence towards P. falciparum and probably parasite transmission through increased sporozoite prevalence in kdr resistant mosquitoes. These results are of great concern for the epidemiology of malaria considering the widespread pyrethroid resistance currently observed in Sub-Saharan Africa and the efforts deployed to control the disease.

AB Background: Particular cytokine gene polymorphisms are involved in the regulation of the antibody production. The consequences of already described IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 gene polymorphisms on biological parameters and antibody levels were investigated among 576 mothers at delivery and their newborns in the context of P. falciparum placental malaria infection.
   Methods: The study took place in the semi-rural area of Tori-Bossito, in south-west Benin, where malaria is meso-endemic. Six biallelic polymorphisms were determined by quantitative PCR using TaqMan (R) Pre Designed SNP Genotyping Assays, in IL-4 (rs2243250, rs2070874), IL-10 (rs1800896, rs1800871, rs1800872) and IL-13 (rs1800925) genes. Antibody responses directed to P. falciparum MSP-1, MSP-2, MSP-3, GLURP-R0, GLURP-R2 and AMA-1 recombinant proteins were determined by ELISA.
   Results: The maternal IL-4(-590)*T/IL-4(+33)*T haplotype (one or two copies) was associated with favorable maternal condition at delivery (high haemoglobin levels, absence of placental parasites) and one of its component, the IL-4(-590) TT genotype, was related to low IgG levels to MSP-1, MSP-2/3D7 and MSP-2/FC27. Inversely, the maternal IL-10(-1082) AA was positively associated with P. falciparum placenta infection at delivery. As a consequence, the IL-10(-819)*T allele (in CT and TT genotypes) as well as the IL-10(-1082)*A/IL-10(-819)*T/IL-10(-592)*A haplotype (one or two copies) in which it is included, were related to an increased risk for anaemia in newborns. The maternal IL-10(-1082) AA genotype was related to high IgG levels to MSP-2/3D7 and AMA-1 in mothers and newborns, respectively. The IL-13 gene polymorphism was only involved in the newborn's antibody response to AMA-1.
   Conclusion: These data revealed that IL-4 and IL-10 maternal gene polymorphisms are likely to play a role in the regulation of biological parameters in pregnant women at delivery (anaemia, P. falciparum placenta infection) and in newborns (anaemia).

   EFFICACY
AB Background: In Benin, the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) changed the policy of malaria treatment in 2004 following increasing of failure rate of treatment with chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). The objective of this study was to determinate the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum molecular markers that are associated with resistance to CQ and SP in Benin seven years after the new policy was instituted.
   Methods: The study was conducted in southern Benin, a region characterized by a perennial malaria transmission. Blood samples were collected in 2011 from children presenting with symptomatic and asymptomatic P. falciparum infections and living in the same area. The prevalence of critical point mutations in the genes of pfcrt (codon 76), pfmdr1 (codon 86), pfdhfr (codons, 51, 59 and 108) and pfdhps (codons 437, 540) was examined in parasite isolates by mutation-specific restriction enzyme digestion of nested PCR products.
   Results: A high prevalence of parasites carrying point mutations in all studied targets was found: T76: 93.9% [89.8; 96.7], I51: 96.2% [92.7; 98.4], R59: 93, 9% [89.7; 96.7], N108: 97.6% [94.6; 99.2] and G437: 71.4% [64.8; 77.4]. No mutation was found at codon 540 of the pfdhps gene. The proportion of parasite isolates carrying triple mutation in the pfdhfr gene IRN (I51, R59 andN108) and quadruple mutation on the combination of pfdhfr/pfdhps IRNG (I51, R59, N108 and G437) was 91.5% [86.9; 94.9] and 65.7% [58.9; 72.1], respectively. Analysis of mutation in relation to the clinical status (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and according to age (younger or older than 10 years) showed similar very high frequencies in each category without significant difference between two groups.
   Conclusions: These results suggest a persistence level of resistance of P. falciparum to CQ and SP, seven years after the recommendation of the change of malaria treatment policy in Benin. The distribution of mutations studied was neither related to age nor to clinical status.

DT Article
ID CONGENITAL MALARIA; INFECTION; LIFE
AB Objective: To investigate the disease burden, clinical features, treatment and outcomes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in neonates and infants weighing <5 kg in five sub-Saharan African countries.
   Methods: Pediatric hospital records were retrospectively reviewed for relevant cases. Details of clinical features, treatment and clinical outcomes were collected, and a descriptive analysis of data was carried out.
   Results: The annual number of malaria cases ranged from 12 to 120 cases across hospitals and calendar years. The most frequent reason for seeking care was fever. Parasite density was low. Quinine was the most common treatment, followed by artemisinin-based combination therapy. The majority of patients recovered from their illness following treatment.
   Conclusion: Plasmodium falciparum malaria exists in this subpopulation. Further epidemiological data are needed to estimate malaria morbidity and mortality in young infants. Moreover, clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based combination therapies in this subpopulation is warranted.

AB Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) was implemented in the department of Oueme Plateau, southern Benin, in 2008 and withdrawn in 2011, when long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were distributed to the communities that were previously targeted by IRS. Did the LLIN strategy provide a better level of protection against malaria transmission than IRS?
   Methods: Entomological surveillance was carried out to assess indicators of transmission risk during the last year of IRS and the first year after the LLIN intervention was put in place (2010-2011). Mosquito biting density was sampled by human landing collection (HLC). Females of Anopheles gambiae s.l. were dissected to estimate the parity rates and the blood meal index. A subsample of the An. gambiae s.l. collection was tested for presence of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. In addition, window exit traps and pyrethrum spray catches were performed to assess exophagic behavior of Anopheles vectors.
   Results: There were significant increases in all the indicators following withdrawal of IRS. Vector biting density (p<0.001) and longevity (OR=3.81[3.01-4.82] 95% CI; p<0.001) of the An. gambiae s.l. increased significantly; so too did the blood meal index (OR=1.48 [1.1-1.99] 95% CI; p<0.001). Entomological inoculation rate, after IRS withdrawal at one surveillance site, Adjohoun, rose two fold (9.0 infected bites/person/9 months (Apr-Dec 2011) versus 3.66 infective bites/person during the 9 months preceding IRS (Apr-Dec 2010). A second site, Misserete, experienced a six-fold increase after IRS cessation (15.1 infective bites/person/9 months versus 2.41 during IRS). Exophily after IRS cessation decreased significantly in all areas (p<0.001) suggesting that mosquitoes were more likely to rest in houses with LLINs, than in houses subjected to IRS.
   Conclusion: LLINs did not impact on indicators of transmission to the same levels as did IRS after IRS withdrawal.

AB Background: Over the past decade, a sharp decline of malaria burden has been observed in several countries. Consequently, the conventional entomological methods have become insufficiently sensitive and probably underestimate micro-geographical heterogeneity of exposure and subsequent risk of malaria transmission. In this study, we investigated whether the human antibody (Ab) response to Anopheles salivary gSG6-P1 peptide, known as a biomarker of Anopheles exposure, could be a sensitive and reliable tool for discriminating human exposure to Anopheles bites in area of low and seasonal malaria transmission.
   Methods: A multi-disciplinary survey was performed in Northern Senegal where An. gambiae s.l. is the main malaria vector. Human IgG Ab response to gSG6-P1 salivary peptide was compared according to the season and villages in children from five villages in the middle Senegal River valley, known as a low malaria transmission area.
   Results: IgG levels to gSG6-P1 varied considerably according to the villages, discriminating the heterogeneity of Anopheles exposure between villages. Significant increase of IgG levels to gSG6-P1 was observed during the peak of exposure to Anopheles bites, and decreased immediately after the end of the exposure season. In addition, differences in the season-dependent specific IgG levels between villages were observed after the implementation of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets by The National Malaria Control Program in this area.
   Conclusion: The gSG6-P1 salivary peptide seems to be a reliable tool to discriminate the micro-geographical heterogeneity of human exposure to Anopheles bites in areas of very low and seasonal malaria transmission. A biomarker such as this could also be used to monitor and evaluate the possible heterogeneous effectiveness of operational vector control programs in low-exposure areas.

AB Background: The diversity of malaria vector populations, expressing various resistance and/or behavioural patterns could explain the reduced effectiveness of vector control interventions reported in some African countries. A better understanding of the ecology and distribution of malaria vectors is essential to design more effective and sustainable strategies for malaria control and elimination. Here, we analyzed the spatio-temporal risk of the contact between humans and the sympatric An. funestus and both M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. in an area of Benin with high coverage of vector control measures with an unprecedented level of resolution.
   Methods: Presence-absence data for the three vectors from 1-year human-landing collections in 19 villages were assessed using binomial mixed-effects models according to vector control measures and environmental covariates derived from field and remote sensing data. After 8-fold cross-validations of the models, predictive maps of the risk of the contact between humans and the sympatric An. funestus and both molecular M and S forms of An. gambiae s.s. were computed.
   Results: Model validations showed that the An. funestus, An. gambiae M form, and S form models provided an excellent (Area Under Curve>0.9), a good (AUC>0.8), and an acceptable (AUC>0.7) level of prediction, respectively. The distribution area of the probability of contact between human and An. funestus largely overlaps that of An. gambiae M form but this latter showed important seasonal variation. An. gambiae S form also showed seasonal variation but with different ecological preferences. Landscape data were useful to discriminate between the species' distributions.
   Conclusions: These results showed that available remote sensing data could help in predicting the human-vector contact for several species of malaria vectors at a village level scale. The predictive maps showed seasonal and spatial variations in the risk of human-vector contact for all three vectors. Such maps could help Malaria Control Programmes to implement more effective vector control strategy by taking into account to the dynamics of malaria vector species.

AB Background: Malaria remains one of the most important illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa. In Benin, it constitutes a major public health preoccupation particularly for children and pregnant women. Until now, population still mostly relies on herbal medicine for malaria healing. Hence this study was carried out to document the medicinal plants used in the plateau of Allada in Benin and to assess local knowledge on traditional medicine in the management of malaria and related symptoms.
   Materials and methods: Data were collected from 53 informants composed of 23 traditional healers and 30 medicinal plants sellers using a structured questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 82 plants species belonging to 78 genera in 43 plant families were recorded as antimalarial in the study area. The families of Rubiaceae and Caesalpiniaceae were the most represented with seven species each. High informant consensus factor (ICF) was recorded in the treatment of malaria (ICF=0.90). High fidelity level (FL=100%) was also recorded for 45.67% of the species used as antimalarial. Dichapetalum madagascariense was the species of high relative frequency of citation (RFC=0.81). The dominant plant parts used in the preparation of remedies were leaves (68%). The decoction (79%) was the main mode of preparation, while oral route (92%) was the principal route of remedies administration.
   Conclusion: This study provides plant species used in the plateau of Allada for malaria and related symptoms treatment. We hope that this study could be important for the conservation of traditional knowledge on the antimalarial plants and the improvement of malaria management. However, several plant species used as antimalarial by the traditional medicine practitioners in the study area need to be screened in order to identify the species having antiplasmodial activity.

AB We investigated the effectiveness of routine preventive measures for anemia in Beninese pregnant women during pregnancy. Anemia (hemoglobin < 110 g/L) was common: 68.3% at first antenatal visit (ANV1), 64.7% at second antenatal visit (ANV2), and 40.6% at delivery. Parasitic infections and nutritional deficiencies were the most preventable causes. After intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) and antihelminthic treatments, malaria prevalence decreased from 15.1% (ANV1) to 4.0% (ANV2) and increased again to 9.6% at delivery. Helminth infections dropped from 11.1% (ANV1) to 7.2% (ANV2) and 2.4% at delivery. Malaria was associated with lower mean hemoglobin on ANV1 and delivery, and iron deficiency was associated with lower mean hemoglobin on ANV1 and ANV2. IPTp and antihelminthic treatments were efficacious to clear parasitic infections and improve hematologic status, whereas the effectiveness of daily iron and folic acid supplements to correct iron and folate deficiencies and decrease anemia was less marked, possibly because of lack of compliance.

AB We studied all consensus sequences within the four least 'variable blocks' (VB) present in the DBL6 epsilon domain of VAR2CSA, the protein involved in the adhesion of infected red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum that causes the Pregnancy-Associated Malaria (PAM). Characterising consensus sequences with respect to recognition of antibodies and percentage of responders among pregnant women living in areas where P. falciparum is endemic allows the identification of the most antigenic sequences within each VB. When combining these consensus sequences among four serotypes from VB1 or VB5, the most often recognized ones are expected to induce pan-reactive antibodies recognizing VAR2CSA from all plasmodial strains. These sequences are of main interest in the design of an immunogenic molecule. Using a similar approach than for DBL6e, we studied the five other DBL and the CIDRpam from VAR2CSA, and again identified VB segments with highly conserved consensus sequences. In addition, we identified consensus sequences in other var genes expressed by non-PAM parasites. This finding paves the way for vaccine design against other pathologies caused by P. falciparum.

AB Objective: To evaluate the contribution of poses screen pre-impregnated (PSP) installed at openings and eaves of dwellings in the reduction of malaria transmission in the commune of Aguegues in Benin. Methods: The PSP were manufactured from preimpregnated Olyset Net. They were installed at windows, eaves and doors of 70 dwellings. 320 children aged 6-59 months were treated and 311 children were recruited in the control zone. Variables measured are: plasmodic index (IP), gametocyte index, parasite density (PD), fever, hemoglobin, anemia. Results: The global IP was 16.62% with PSP and 72.20% without PSP. Gametocyte index did not differ significantly between the treated zone (27.8) and the control zone (29.1). The total geometric mean of DP was 309 in the treated zone and 600 in the control zone. Hemoglobin level is 8.7 in the control zone and 9.5 in the treated zone. We noted a predominance of anemia in the control zone compared to the treated zone. Conclusions: The PSP have contributed to a significant reduction in morbidity in the commune of Aguegues.
